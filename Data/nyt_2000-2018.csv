2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Long, Steep and Lovely in Aspen;None;Travel Desk;article;News;WHILE the jet setters schuss down the groomed slopes of Aspen Mountain in their designer ski outfits and enjoy first-class food at the summit lodge, the hard-core ski and snowboard set skips lunch altogether and seeks whatever powder can be found on the steep, raw terrain at neighboring Aspen Highlands. Instead of a pampered gondola ride, hardy skiers hike the 30 minutes to the 12,392-foot summit of the Highland Bowl. Aspen Highlands rounds out the variety of terrain from beginner to extreme offered by Aspen's four mountains. The others are Aspen Mountain, Snowmass and Buttermilk.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Making of an Ice Princess;George Ernsberger letter on Jesse Green's article about figure skating and Emily Hughes (Dec 18);Magazine;article;Letter;Thanks for Jesse Green's terrific article (Dec. 18) about figure skating and Emily Hughes. I think he may have overstated the percentage of wealthy families of serious skaters, but it's still a wonderfully intelligent and thoughtful piece.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Quick Bite/Millburn; When in Essex, Shop as the Romans Do;None;New Jersey Weekly Desk;article;Review;The word famiglia in a food store's name can be problematic. Named to suggest a homemade quality to the food it sells (perhaps even using nonna's recipe), a famiglia store runs the risk of criticism if it fails to deliver authentic food. But if the food is good -- or better yet, excellent, as it is at Mia Famiglia in Millburn -- a famiglia store is the go-to place when you need to cater your own family gatherings (but don't think anyone will believe you when you try to pass off the food as a family recipe). Mia Famiglia is the rare Italian store in that it actually resembles a store you could find in Italy. Or as owner Emanuele Licitra puts it, ''When people from Italy come in here they say, 'I feel like I'm home'.'' That's probably because they recognize many brands as what they have in their cupboards.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Hangover Helpers: Beyond Sheep Eyes;British and Dutch researchers conduct study on prevention and treatment of hangovers; research, which is published in journal BMJ, finds no evidence to support claimed remedies; various unproven hangover management techniques and folk remedies described; doctors agree that only sure cure for hangover is abstinence from alcohol; photos (M);Style Desk;article;News;THE last time Nan Anane, a graphic designer in San Francisco, had one beer too many during a night out with friends, his first stop the next morning was to his local Mexican taqueria, where he ordered tostadas made with ceviche, uncooked fish cured with citrus juice. ''It really brings me back from that headache and bodyache,'' he said. ''Something about near-raw fish really breathes life back into you.'' Outer Mongolians are said to have feasted on pickled sheep eyeballs in tomato juice. Cattle ropers in the Old West supposedly sipped tea brewed from rabbit dung. Russians have been known to drip vodka over fatty sausage into a tumbler and then drink it. Long before the ancient Egyptians started raising a beer in honor of the god Osiris, human beings have been in search of hangover relief, and this morning, as people wake up groggy from yet another New Year's Eve, there will be dozens of cures to choose from that go far beyond the traditional Alka-Seltzer.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;If the Avian Flu Hasn't Hit, Here's Why. Maybe.;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;WILD birds have completed their seasonal migration, and it appears that the United States has dodged the avian flu threat for now. The pattern of the semiannual migration itself provides some protection. On the three main flyways of the Western Hemisphere, migratory birds travel roughly north-south, with only relatively small areas in the Arctic and far northern regions where birds fly east-west, to and from Asia and Europe. In the Eastern Hemisphere, however, where five main flyways interconnect, the virus can spread much more easily. The route over East Asia, where the deadly H5N1 virus has killed millions of birds and at least 74 humans, overlaps with the Central Asian flyway, which overlaps with those to Africa and Europe.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;President Uses Vacation to Prepare Agenda for 2006;Pres Bush will return early from his vacation with ambitious strategy for 2006; has scheduled major speeches on economy and on Iraq, and hopes to have Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Samuel A Alito Jr and renewal of Patriot Act behind him before State of the Union address on Jan 31; is concerned about minor revolt of Congressional Republicans, but has decided to take hard line with Congressional inquiries into his secret authorization of warrantless surveillance by National Security Agency; photo (M);National Desk;article;News;For six days, President Bush has stayed in nearly complete isolation on his ranch here -- just mountain-biking and brush-clearing, the White House insisted daily, with only one guest, his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch. He never even ventured into this little town of about 700, not even to the cheeseburger joint that he often used as a political stage to show that he is in touch with his Texas neighbors. But on New Year's Day, after a brief stop at an Army hospital in San Antonio to visit wounded soldiers, Mr. Bush is scheduled to return to the White House earlier than usual from his break and start a campaign to set the tone for 2006 and, perhaps, the remainder of his presidency.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Pas de Deux of Dance and Film;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;THE Dance on Camera Festival is one of those New York stealth events, prized by its devotees and blissfully unknown to everyone else. This year it will set up shop on Wednesday for the 10th time at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, and despite some invariable ups and downs, it will once again be well worth attending. That's partly because a lot of the films being shown are very good, for one reason or another. Where else, in the dead of winter, can you find a joyful reunion of a troupe of former Apollo Theater chorus dancers called the Silver Belles (opening night)? Or two feature-length films about southern Indian dance, one a stilted but sincere dramatization of a temple dancer's protofeminist rebellion against sexual servitude in the 1920's, the other a documentary about a venerable master of Kathakali dance drama?
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;An Ocean Agenda for New York;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Editorial;It's no secret that the oceans are under siege. In recent years, two major commissions -- the Congressionally established United States Commission on Ocean Policy and the independent Pew Oceans Commission -- have urged prompt action to end overfishing of commercially valuable species, reduce pollution from cities and farms, restore wetlands and control development along the coasts. Obviously, a problem of this magnitude requires intervention by Washington and even international organizations, but the states -- which control waters up to three miles offshore -- also have important roles to play. With that in mind, some states, notably California, have recently strengthened their laws and overhauled the way they manage ocean resources. Now a coalition of environmental groups is urging Gov. George Pataki to do the same.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;At the Outset, It's a Matter Of Mood;None;Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;News;THE first week of the year may begin with traders following their hearts and end with them following their heads. John K. Lynch, the chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments, predicted that the stock market would have a subdued start to the year as traders react first to the inability of the Dow Jones industrial average to hang on to a gain for 2005. The loss last week, resulting in a decline of 0.6 percent for the Dow last year, ''will affect sentiment going into the week,'' Mr. Lynch said.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Saying Farewell To a Supermarket;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: I read with regret of the projected closing of the Western Beef supermarket on 14th Street and Ninth Avenue (''Got Beef? Not Anymore,'' Dec. 25). While I consider myself a ''grocery aficionado,'' I can't be the only one for whom the chain's ''wonderfully odd'' logo is irrelevant.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Trash Disposal: Recycling Isn't Enough;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: Your article about Long Island's looming trash disposal crisis (''A Long, Long Haul From the Curb,'' Dec. 4) and subsequent letters emphasized the need for solutions beyond long-hauling waste to a landfill. But substantial waste will still remain for disposal even after recycling. We need to focus on where to dispose of this post-recycled waste.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Working at the PC Isn't So Lonely Anymore;James Fallows column reviews prerelease version of AquaMinds software program called NoteShare, designed specifically for social aspects of computing; offers partial list, because this is his last monthly Techno Files column for New York Times, of items he hoped to work through; photo (M);Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;News;IN the beginning, personal computers were for loners. You sat at the desk and stared at the screen. To involve anyone else in what you were doing, you had to pull up an extra chair at that same desk, or carry a printout or floppy disk containing your work to a friend's or a workmate's machine. Working with computers became interesting, as opposed to merely useful, when it became a social activity. E-mail was the first big step, and the Internet the second. Now, with the BlackBerry and Skype and municipal WiFi and the omnipresent cellphone, it is tempting to think that technology has given us too many ways to stay in touch.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Start Puts Pistons in Elite Company;Detroit Pistons have 24-4 record, best start in team history; photo (M)1;Sports Desk;article;News;The Bulls. The subject is somewhat taboo around the Pistons' organization these days. For Detroit players and personnel, the 1995-96 Chicago team, which set the N.B.A. record for victories in a season with 72, is an elephant of a footnote better worth ignoring. At 24-4, the Pistons are off to their best start despite yesterday's 97-84 loss to Cleveland, which stopped Detroit's nine-game winning streak. The '95-96 Bulls started 23-3, then rattled off 18 straight victories for a record mark of 41-3. The Pistons, of course, don't have Michael Jordan, but Detroit has something almost as powerful, albeit more intangible.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;CUTE, GOOD-LOOKING STAFF;None;Travel Desk;article;News;When your boutique hotel is as gorgeous as a supermodel, the last thing you want is to muck it up with employees who aren't runway material. Or at least that was the thinking behind the chic hotels that materialized during the go-go 1990's. Who cared if the doorman couldn't be bothered to open the door, or the bathroom attendant was too busy checking herself in the mirror to hand you a towel? What mattered was that the staff could complement the hip décor like creatures from a Calvin Klein ad.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;DATEBOOK;None;Travel Desk;article;Schedule;STE.-CATHERINE-DE-LA-JACQUES-CARTIER, QUEBEC Each January, the Ice Hotel Quebec-Canada, below, is built anew with tons of ice and snow and stays open until warmer weather starts to melt it away, by early April. It is opening Jan. 6 with 34 guest rooms, a dance club, an ice bar, art galleries and even a chapel. Overnight rates start at $199 Canadian (about $172 U.S., at $1.18 Canadian to the American dollar), including a cocktail, access to the hot tub and sauna, and all the accoutrements of lodging in sub-freezing conditions (a sleeping bag, blanket and pillow). Call 877-505-0423 or see www.icehotel-canada.com for information. Day tours of the hotel are $14.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;With a Screenplay And a Prayer;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;At a new workshop for screenwriters in Atlanta, the participants discuss both ''The Shawshank Redemption'' and ''South Park.'' There are matters of plot and character to analyze, of course. But this particular conversation circles back to questions of faith that can be helpful to screenwriters incorporating Christian beliefs into their work. The writers are part of the inaugural class of Art Within Labs, modeled on the Sundance Institute. But instead of secular independent films, this program is trying to nurture spiritual work.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Nose Has Its Reasons;Perfumer Lynn Harris describes personal joy she feels using Swiffer mop, which does not need cleaners to clean floor and therefore does not leave unwanted smell; photos (M);Style Desk;article;News;FANTASTIC sights, glorious sounds, fabulous tactile sensations: all have the power to elate, a truth borne out by Technicolor, Sensurround and Blackglama. But nothing has the time-traveling-transport potential of a special smell, as anyone can tell you who, years later, catches a whiff of a lost love. It can lead you by the nose, even briefly, into a past of emotion and sensation like no other stimulus. This is a strength -- a weakness? -- that perfumers play to, creating hosts of new memories and summoning bouquets of old ones with tactically designed brews, whether a Parisian fragrance or an American detergent. The British perfumer Lynn Harris honed the art sharper than most when she began cooking up customized perfumes a decade ago, before introducing her own fragrance line, Miller Harris, in 2000.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Performance-Based Pay For Politicians?;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: ''Pols Deserve a Raise?

I believe that some cost-of-living salary adjustment for legislators would be appropriate provided they tie their salaries to performance.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Out West, Aussie Style;None;Travel Desk;article;News;WESTERN AUSTRALIA sits way out there on the edge of things. It is a gigantic place, nearly four times the size of Texas, and mostly empty, with a smaller population than Nevada's. Its hospitable modern capital, Perth, where nearly three-quarters of its people live, is one of the most isolated cities on earth, separated by a vast continental desert from Sydney and more than 2,000 miles from any other major city. The southwestern corner of the state, including Perth and the gorgeous Margaret River area, faces west across the Indian Ocean, enjoying a Mediterranean climate and its perquisites -- superb locally produced wines, wonderful food and a relaxed way of life. Plus world-class museums, uncrowded white sand beaches, soaring hardwood forests and abundant wildflowers in springtime (meaning September, of course).
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;COMPETENT STAFF;None;Travel Desk;article;News;Being attractive still won't get you fired, but not knowing the checkout time might. Guests now demand good service, said Bjorn Hansen, a hotel consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the 90's, ''consumers wanted something extravagant and frivolous,'' he said. ''Today, the focus is on productivity and convenience.'' Take the Setai in South Beach, which combines minimalist design with white-glove service. ''Our core staff is of largely Asian heritage who have gone to Swiss hotel schools,'' said Manvinder Puri, the manager of the Setai, which is owned by GHM, a sister company to Amanresorts. ''Appearance is important, but it's in the grooming, not in God's will.''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Tasty Morsel or Two From the Smorgasbord Of a Big Group Show;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Review;LARGE, sprawling group exhibitions are like all-you-can-eat restaurants: There is usually too much available and none of it very good. But occasionally you hit upon something tasty and out of the ordinary, like Masha Ryskin's and Margaret Kimura's billowing fabric installation upstairs at the Westchester Arts Council Arts Exchange Gallery in White Plains. It is raw, inventive and trippy -- qualities that seem an embodiment of the condition of contemporary art now. Their installation is part of ''Winter Solstice IV,'' an annual holiday season talent roundup shared, this year, between the Studio: An Alternative Space for Contemporary Art in Armonk, and the Arts Exchange. The combined two-site package is a handsome, dizzyingly eclectic sampler of the work of just over 50 artists gathered from the Westchester area and beyond. About a third of the artists are taking part in the exhibition for the first time.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;WINE UNDER $20; A Spanish Twist On Tradition;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Review;Although daylong Champagne toasts traditionally welcome the new year, some wine aficionados prefer fino and manzanilla sherries. They consider these delicate dry Spanish whites the Old World's finest aperitifs, and symbolically perfect to introduce a 365-day banquet of life. Both taste brightest when fresh. Hidalgo's nonvintage La Gitana manzanilla, lightly chilled and slowly sipped, is a standout. Finish the 500-milliliter bottle in a day or two. Sea Grape, 512 Hudson Street (West 10th Street), charges $10.99. HOWARD G. GOLDBERG
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Ukraine and Belarus, Separated at Birth;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;ELECTIONS will take place this spring in two former Soviet republics, Ukraine and Belarus, that are headed in very different directions after 14 years of independence. The outcomes could reverberate across Europe's eastern frontier. On March 19, Belarus is to hold a presidential election that will return its autocratic leader, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to power. Very few doubt the outcome, because very few believe the election will be fair.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Woodbridge Breaks Impasse With 2 Utilities;None;Connecticut Weekly Desk;article;News;TRYING to keep up with soaring demand for electricity in the region, two utilities have been battling to upgrade their overhead power lines with an ambitious $1.3 billion plan that reached from Bethel to Middletown. But when they got to Woodbridge, near New Haven, they faced the wrath of local residents and their lawyers who feared that the thousands of children in their community who go to school and play near the lines were being put at risk. The residents and the utilities finally put their heads together earlier this month and came up with a novel solution to the classic not-in-my-backyard problem: make the backyard bigger.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Trojans and Colts Have Titles in Sights;Dave Anderson The Year in Review discusses football highlights of 2005; photo (S)/;Sports Desk;article;News;As 2006 arrived, football played a waiting game: waiting for the playoffs and Super Bowl XL, waiting for the Rose Bowl showdown between Southern California and Texas for the national championship, and waiting to see the Saints, evicted from the Louisiana Superdome by Hurricane Katrina, return to New Orleans next season. The reigning Super Bowl champion New England Patriots were among eight teams, including the Giants, that qualified for the playoffs going into this weekend's season finales. Six teams pursued the other four slots. Indianapolis, which raced to a 13-0 start with a bolder defense supporting quarterback Peyton Manning, and Seattle clinched the No. 1 seedings in the conferences.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Four Years On, a Cabin's-Eye View of 9/11;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;WITH a violent shudder, the front of a reconstructed Boeing 757 pitches toward the ground. Actors struggle not to slide from their seats, some screaming, one chanting, ''Oh, my God.'' A camera flits from seat to seat, stopping to focus on individual vignettes of terror, as an actor playing a hijacker barks, ''Sit down!'' over the loudspeaker. After almost universally shying away from the topic for the past four years, Hollywood is turning in full force to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. Painful memories, all-too-familiar news clips and personal stories are now being transformed into big-screen dramas, as studios look for commercial value in the still-fresh trauma, while prompting the mass audience to revisit its thoughts and feelings.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;This Bag Speaks For You;Carolyn Whiting, zbeckybrown.com company president, describes Creative Clazzic, polymer handbag that can be personalized like wearable scrapbook; photo (S);Style Desk;article;News;On your mark, rubber-stampers, fashion customizers and clever women in general: the scrapbooking handbag has arrived. Called the Creative Clazzic ($68 to $72 at www.zbeckybrown.com), it is a polymer pocketbook with clear external pockets to hold and display handmade collages, cartoons, photographs, cocktail napkins, love letters or, if you insist, matchy-matchy fabrics. ''Making your own statement is really hot right now,'' said Carolyn Whiting, the company's president. ''Needlepoint ladies just love this.'' Those who don't needlepoint have personalized the Clazzic with favorite CD covers, concert tickets and photos of boyfriends. The purse will be included in the 2006 Academy Awards presenters' gift bag. Where better to flash pictures of that gorgeous star, you? SUSAN GUERRERO
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Cowboys Are My Weakness;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;SOMEBODY had to write this, and it might as well be me. I haven't seen ''Brokeback Mountain,'' nor do I have any intention of seeing it. In fact, cowboys would have to lasso me, drag me into the theater and tie me to the seat, and even then I would make every effort to close my eyes and cover my ears. And I love gay people. Hey, I've got gay acquaintances. Good acquaintances, who know they can call me anytime if they had my phone number. I'm for gay marriage, gay divorce, gay this and gay that. I just don't want to watch two straight men, alone on the prairie, fall in love and kiss and hug and hold hands and whatnot. That's all.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; THEATER;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;Losing your job is one of the less festive holiday traditions on Broadway this time of year, when ticket sales plummet and producers finally decide to call it quits. Here's a quick roundup of the seasonal face-lift: ''LATINOLOGUES,'' ''SWEET CHARITY'' and ''CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG'' closed last week, and audiences looking to see ''SEASCAPE'' (closes Jan. 8), ''FIDDLER ON THE ROOF'' (Jan. 8) or ''SOUVENIR'' (Jan. 8) better act fast. The same goes for fans of JOHN LITHGOW and CHERRY JONES, who leave ''DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS'' and ''DOUBT,'' respectively, in the next few weeks . The most interesting change might be in the cast of ''SPAMALOT,'' which has recruited the brilliant English classical actor SIMON RUSSELL BEALE to take over for TIM CURRY. Mr. Beale has already demonstrated that he can breathe life into the great monologues of Shakespeare and Chekhov. But can he do a silly walk? ''Spamalot'' is playing at the Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. So you're nursing a hangover and trying to forget those resolutions that are never going to be kept. The last thing you want to do is see ''MEASURE FOR MEASURE,'' Shakespeare's dark comedy that touches on capital punishment, sexual harassment and moral hypocrisy (fun, fun and fun!). But hold on: the New York Times critic Charles Isherwood, who saw the play in Philadelphia, has said that the all-male production, directed by and starring MARK RYLANCE, is genuinely, surprisingly funny. Who knows? It may be just the thing to forget last night. The play closes tonight at St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779.

Mrs. Fishman, 35, is a music teacher at Shady Hill, a private elementary and middle school in Cambridge, Mass. She also teaches piano at Groton, the private high school in Groton, Mass. She graduated from the University of Colorado, where she also received a master's degree in piano performance. She has a master's in education from Harvard.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Armstrong Retires, And Patrick Arrives;Dave Anderson The Year In Review column discusses 2005 moments in sports; photos (S)6;Sports Desk;article;News;Lance Armstrong, saying it would be his final Tour de France, pedaled through Paris in triumph for a record seventh consecutive year. Retiring after the final stage at age 33, he said he intended to devote himself to the Lance Armstrong Foundation's campaign to raise money and awareness for cancer research. In auto racing, Tony Stewart won the points championship of Nascar's top series for the second time, and Danica Patrick stirred interest in the Indianapolis 500, leading with six laps to go before finishing fourth after having to slow to save fuel.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Cross the Line;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Op-Ed;I'VE never been big on New Year's resolutions, but here is one worth considering: starting in 2006, let's all think of the things that unite us as Hudson Valley residents, rather than what divides us, like county lines. The Hudson Valley -- which includes Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties, among others -- has emerged as a distinct region, with an identity that warrants our acknowledgment, indeed our pride. The valley and its storied river have received virtually every federal and state accolade available for regions and water bodies of national significance. For instance, Congress has designated the Hudson River Valley a National Heritage Area. President Bill Clinton declared the Hudson an American Heritage River. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the river, whose salty waters flow both ways, an Estuary of National Significance. And last year First Lady Laura Bush designated historic landmarks in Putnam and Dutchess Counties as Preserve America sites. These titles are not merely ceremonial; they bring local, regional and national advocates for the environment, culture and heritage of the Hudson Valley together to work for its preservation and enhancement as the foundation of the area's economy.

With Everyone);None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;FROM the airy second-floor ballroom of a once-grand hotel, David Swain, the preening, pugilistic focus of ABC's new show ''In Justice,'' presides over an organization he calls the National Justice Project. Loosely based on the many ''innocence projects'' that have sprung up across the country since the advent of DNA testing, the show, in its promotional materials, claims to offer ''a completely new take on the procedural drama.'' The criminal justice system has always made for good drama, and over the years the political and narrative tides have shifted back and forth between the values of protecting the innocent and nailing the guilty. But 15 years into the reign of ''Law & Order'' (with no end in sight), ''In Justice'' makes it clear that even a series about wrongful conviction must tiptoe around the idea of setting the inmates free.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   SMITH, DAVID ANTHONY;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;SMITH--David Anthony. Age 65, died of lung cancer in New York City on December 24. He is survived by his wife, Mary R. Smith, and his two daughters, Annie and Sarah Smith, all of New York. David's career in international development began when he and his wife were transformed by their experience as Peace Corps Volunteers in Enugu, Nigeria from 1963-1966. After returning to a US immersed in a civil rights' struggle and the Vietnam War, David and Mary settled in Middletown, Connecticut where their daughters were born. He became the Director of Community Action for Greater Middletown, an agency of the Poverty Program. His life long commitment to humanity and justice continued as he worked in international development for the rest of his career. Most recently, he had been Chief of Party for the Civic Advocacy Support Program in Tashkent for Counterpart Foundation.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Off Center;Mark Schmitt letter disagrees with Matt Bai Dec 11 (2005) review of Jacob S Hacker and Paul Pierson book Off Center;Book Review Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: Matt Bai has evidently been working the ''Democrats are losers'' beat for so long that he can't recognize when a book is about an entirely different subject. ''Off Center,'' by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson (Dec. 11), does not principally try to explain why Republicans win elections. Instead, it takes up the question of how it is that this particular Republicanmajority has been able to take policy in a direction far out of line with what Bai agrees is the generally moderate consensus of public opinion. Political science and common sense tell us that if a governing party steps too far from the mainstream of public opinion, that party will suffer political consequences, which is why majorities usually move cautiously. The question Hacker and Pierson consider, using rigorous methods, is how this Republican majority, unlike majorities of either party in the past, was able to develop a system of governance that seems to protect it from those timeless rules.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Competitors Refocus Plans for Coliseum Site;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;News;THE competition to redevelop the 77-acre Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum site in Uniondale, and in the process to create a new suburban center in Nassau County, has taken on a new look in the last week. But the eventual picture will not include Charles B. Wang's 60-story lighthouse tower. Two of the four proposals for the site underwent major revisions -- most notably the withdrawal of plans for the tower by Mr. Wang, the owner of the New York Islanders and a founder of Computer Associates of Islandia, and Scott Rechler, the chief executive of Reckson Associates Realty of Melville.

Yes, round, and that means round paintings, round sculptures and artworks of all shapes and art media employing any thing, image or object that is vaguely curvy, looped or oval. It is a lame theme, to be honest, but it somehow results in a cute show.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;'City of a Million Bugs';None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Text;From ''Brain Guy,'' by Benjamin Appel Eastwards Forty-second was a foam of yellow light. Following its course with his eyes, he somehow felt broker than hell. He was the crème de la crème to waiters, but the world's biggest mug anywheres else. His face was Christless as a panhandler's. He thought about shaking down one of the speaks or joints that he managed discreetly as a real estate collector. Who could he shake down without too much of a squawk? Crowds passed before him as if pinned immovable to metal strips. The crossroads of the world. Hot air. He killed time. The city of a million bugs chasing their behinds off for a few nickels. He was a louse, too, always broke, always in a panic to get some dough. Fastened to the fate of the metal strips, endless men and women were having their impact on his vision. Where were they going? What were their lives and what the hell was the difference?
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Democrats Keep The Senate in Sight;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;IT has been a while since Democrats have held such high hopes for an election year -- confident of, at the least, making significant gains in the Republican-controlled House and Senate. In truth, Democratic hopes of winning back the House are somewhat remote. They have a better shot at capturing the Senate. A few races are worth tracking for early signs about how realistic these hopes are.

The federation had decided to allow Nardiello to remain as the head coach of the United States team through the Turin Olympics in February. But officials accelerated their response after two female skeleton athletes and a coach made their accusations public Friday.

She gave a good sense of what circus life is like for a young teenager, placing him in the context of family, yet independent. I have a 13-year-old son and a 15-year-old son, and it was helpful for them to see the success of someone their own age and to see that life is still open for them. They are at the edge of adult life, open and dreaming and doing. I hope to find more articles as well thought out. Catherine Turocy New York City

(Rarely has caller ID seemed so heaven-sent.) Anyone who didn't realize that charities are exempt from the registry's rules surely knows it by now, for many nonprofits were relentless in their appeals. Why? Probably because they were in dire need of funds.

The goal, the 19th for the 18-year-old Crosby, gave the Penguins only their second two-game winning streak of the season; their first was in early November.

This richly layered memoir chronicles the life of one of Israel's most acclaimed novelists. Tracing his ancestors back to 19th-century Ukraine, Oz weaves his family's history into the broader story of World War II, the rise of the Israeli state and the death of the socialist-Zionist dream. Oz returns often to his mother's suicide in 1952, when he was 12: the wound shapes his self-discovery and the story of how he became a writer. Our reviewer, John Leonard, called this book ''indelible.''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;About That Raise;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Editorial;It would be hard for us to say whether Westchester's county legislators deserve the hefty pay raises they were trying to slide quietly past the voters in recent days. Making such a judgment requires a difficult consideration of many complicated factors. You'd have to weigh how much they make against how much they do. You'd want to compare what other people make in jobs requiring similar levels of effort and brain power and figure out whether the drain on the county treasury would be offset by greater productivity and even more dazzling lawmaking from 17 newly energized, no-longer-aggrieved public servants.

A tall, lithe man with a graying sea captain's beard, Mr. McCamy, 67, and five other village workers erected the ice rink walls in Mitchell Park in November, then rolled out mats of coolant-carrying pipes, hooked them up to a refrigeration unit, turned it on and hosed the oval with water for four days.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Bankruptcy? Tougher Than Counseling a Soprano;None;Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;News;IN 1999, the debut of ''The Sopranos'' placed Lorraine Bracco, the actress who plays Tony Soprano's psychiatrist, on a trajectory that has made her a household name. That was also the year she filed for personal bankruptcy, an experience that she says was the nadir of her life. ''I went to go lease a car, and it became a trauma,'' she said, recalling a humiliation that still lingers in her memory. ''I said to the rental car people: 'This is a done deal.' And they said: 'We are sorry. We are great fans, but we are not going to lease you the car.' ''

On Oct. 11, the man, Ruben Valentin, 41, was found lying on the floor at the bottom of a stairwell in the building where he lived, at 1229 Franklin Avenue, the police said.

So when she encountered the one of her dreams, she had no doubt about what to do. ''I finally met a piano I really loved,'' Ms. Bielawa said. ''So I thought I would move in with it.'' Ms. Bielawa, 37, a concert-music composer and vocalist, figured out that the cost of moving the piano from Upper Manhattan to her apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, was so high that it made more sense to simply move into the two-bedroom rental being vacated by the piano's owners.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Postcards From 2005: Glory and a Ghost;George Vecsey Sports of The Times column discusses memorable moments in sports in 2005; drawings (M)i;Sports Desk;article;News;WITH the world reeling from disasters, both natural and man-made, a wandering sports columnist is sometimes a few days behind or ahead of tragedy. For all that, there were great events and charismatic athletes -- in addition to memorable datelines for a new set of postcards. PORT ST. LUCIE, FLA., FEB. 17 -- On a coast recently disfigured by hurricanes, spring training begins. Two former rivals, Willie Randolph and Pedro Martínez, are united as the Mets' manager and their ace. Martínez will give Randolph a superlative season, on and off the field. WASHINGTON, MARCH 2 -- Jackie Robinson, the pioneer Brooklyn Dodger, is honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda as dozens of black lawmakers attend. President Bush and Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, share a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in praising Robinson. WASHINGTON, MARCH 17 -- Mark McGwire is the most visibly pathetic of five baseball stars testifying before Congress, declining to address his use of a body-building drug. Rafael Palmeiro will be humbled in August, when he is suspended for 10 games after testing positive for steroids. Before the year is out, pressure from Congress will shame the union and the owners into accepting much stricter penalties. BIRMINGHAM, ALA., MARCH 29 -- Roderick Jackson, a teacher and family man, jeopardized his livelihood by taking on the school board for the right of his girls basketball team to have facilities matching the boys'. Today he quietly celebrates a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that essentially protects whistleblowers. Then he excuses himself to go back to his students. WASHINGTON, APRIL 14 -- After 33 years, baseball returns to D.C. as the relocated Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, defeat Arizona, 5-3. Frank Robinson's team will finish with a respectable 81-81 record and draw 2.7 million fans, eighth best in the National League. BOSTON, APRIL 11 -- Two classes in nearby Acton, Mass., have proposed that the Yankees and the Red Sox shake hands at the home opener, in a gesture of sportsmanship. Although this is not about to happen, most Yankees do sit respectfully in the dugout to observe the Boston sports heroes Johnny Pesky, Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Bill Russell, Bobby Orr, Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour take the field as the Red Sox receive their 2004 World Series rings. AUGUSTA, GA., APRIL 18 -- Lance Armstrong, not yet 34, announces he will retire after this summer's Tour de France. Then he leads his Discovery Channel team for a week's romp in the Tour de Georgia. NEW YORK, MAY 25 -- Stunned Italian fans put aside old regional rivalries and root for A.C. Milan at L'Angolo in Greenwich Village. On television from far-off Istanbul, Liverpool ties the score after trailing at halftime, 3-0, then beats Milan on penalty kicks, in one of the greatest reversals in a Champions League final. LONDON, JUNE 29 -- It's not every day that a Yank sports columnist walks up to 10 Downing Street and interviews Tony Blair. Blair will travel to Singapore in a few hours to promote London's candidacy to be the 2012 Olympic host. Paris has the perceived edge, but Blair's competitive streak is matched by that of Sebastian Coe, the track gold medalist and the leader of the London bid group. WIMBLEDON, England, JULY 3 -- A stunned Andy Roddick wins only 12 games from Roger Federer in three sets in the Wimbledon final, and says, ''I want it real bad, but he's beating me.'' A day earlier, Venus Williams outlasted Lindsay Davenport in a tense three-set final. PARIS, JULY 6 -- With a dark cloud dropping sprinkles over City Hall, at 1:49 p.m., Parisians learn the host of the 2012 Summer Games. ''Londres, London,'' says a voice from distant Singapore. The Parisians scuttle away, almost silently. New York's impractical dream of a mixed-use West Side facility has been mercifully rejected. NANCY, FRANCE, JULY 7 -- Driving to catch up with the Tour de France, I hear on French radio descriptions of terrorist bombings in London, where we were taking the Underground and buses a few days earlier. KARLSRUHE, GERMANY, JULY 8 -- ''I'm more afraid than in the past,'' Armstrong admits in a morning cellphone chat. Going for his seventh straight championship, Armstrong says he plans to avoid nasty collisions on this rainy day, knowing his mates will protect him. COURCHEVEL, FRANCE, JULY 12 -- Armstrong regains the lead in the Tour, even though he appears to ease up from the saddle during a close uphill finish in the Alps, allowing a young Spaniard to win the stage. Lance knows what he needs, day by day. ST-LARY-SOULAN, FRANCE, JULY 17 -- Paying homage to a friend, Fabio Casartelli, who died in a crash on this course 10 years earlier, Armstrong maintains his lead. His chief blocker, big George Hincapie, wins his first stage in a tense climb high in the Pyrenees. GAILLAC, FRANCE, JULY 20 -- My wife and I vote this the most perfect evening of the Tour -- dinner with my cousin Jen and her husband, Sam, in La Verrerie, a tiny auberge in the woods, under a full moon, two fish courses, great wine. Circling this beautiful country, we feel privileged to revisit Nancy, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Montpelier, Pau, Toulouse, Lyon. Months later, we will follow the urban unrest in French cities. ST-ÉTIENNE, FRANCE, JULY 23 -- Armstrong wins the time trial to clinch his championship. Tomorrow he will cycle into drizzly Paris to celebrate. But the sport is haunted by suggestions of widespread drug use by some riders. PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., SEPT. 1 -- Many a sports journalist has spent time in New Orleans, now devastated by Hurricane Katrina. I mourn for the people of that unique city, and rage at the ineptitude of public officials. NEW YORK, SEPT. 10 and 11 -- At Flushing Meadows, two of the most popular and athletic players in the game, Roger Federer and Kim Clijsters, win the United States Open this weekend. The best match? Andre Agassi dispatching the local favorite, James Blake, in a five-set late-night quarterfinal. BOSTON, OCT. 7 -- Last year they were idiots. The year before they were cowboys. This year the Red Sox are history, going down in three straight games in the first round to another ancient franchise, the White Sox. CHICAGO, OCT. 23 -- After yet another umpiring call goes their way, the White Sox take a 2-0 lead in the World Series. ''Maybe it's Shoeless Joe,'' says Brad Ausmus, the astute Houston catcher, perhaps sensing that the White Sox are about to exorcise the gloomy spell dating to Joe Jackson and the scandalous 1919 Black Sox. NEW YORK, NOV. 5 -- After a year's absence because of a labor dispute, hockey is back, with more wide-open play under new rules. NEW YORK, NOV. 16 -- Nine fans jam into a Brooklyn apartment to watch Trinidad and Tobago play Bahrain for the first World Cup berth for one of the teams. Before the game, Paul Caligiuri of the United States, who helped beat T&T 16 years earlier to keep it out of the World Cup, calls my cellphone to wish luck to the fans. Two hours later, the Trinis are happy. SEATTLE, NOV. 27 -- Jay Feely misses three late field goals for the Giants, then has the character to address reporters. The surging Seahawks seem likely to play host to a playoff game or two in January. NEW YORK, NOV. 30 -- Tony Stewart, winner of the Nextel Cup, burns rubber in the canyons of Midtown as Nascar celebrates its new TV contract and its growth around the United States. LEIPZIG, GERMANY, DEC. 9 -- Bach and Mendelssohn once composed in this tiny city in the eastern part of the country. Now FIFA holds its draw for the 2006 World Cup, putting the United States in a rugged group with the Czech Republic, Italy and Ghana. I wonder how many of the 12 host cities I will be able to visit in 2006 -- for epic games, for new postcards. In the meantime, Happy New Year.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Police Charge Six In Cellphone Pot Sales;None;Connecticut Weekly Desk;article;News;The police in Farmington recently arrested six teenagers, charging them with involvement in a marijuana deal pitched to potential buyers on their camera phones. Detectives were tipped off after the mother of a Farmington High School student saw an advertisement for the marijuana, with a photograph and text, while using his cellphone, the police said. She notified the police, who obtained warrants to monitor cellphone calls and messages from the suspects and also began to watch them.

But instead of pumping up the school's basketball team before a big game, the pep rally is held to inspire the school's fourth graders before they take the state English test.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Chillin' in Cape May;None;New Jersey Weekly Desk;article;News;MANY years ago, Mark Kulkowitz said, ''when Abraham Lincoln was president,'' he and his wife, Pam, wanted a quiet wedding. They chose to do it at his father's bed and breakfast, the Carroll Villa in Cape May. ''No one would be in town, since it was winter,'' Mr. Kulkowitz said. ''That was the Cape May way.''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;An Ocean Agenda for New York;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Editorial;It's no secret that the oceans are under siege. In recent years, two major commissions -- the Congressionally established United States Commission on Ocean Policy and the independent Pew Oceans Commission -- have urged prompt action to end overfishing of commercially valuable species, reduce pollution from cities and farms, restore wetlands and control development along the coasts. Obviously, a problem of this magnitude requires intervention by Washington and even international organizations, but the states -- which control waters up to three miles offshore -- also have important roles to play. With that in mind, some states, notably California, have recently strengthened their laws and overhauled the way they manage ocean resources. Now a coalition of environmental groups is urging Gov. George Pataki to do the same.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Mr. Bloomberg's Encore;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Mayor Michael Bloomberg rides to a second inauguration today on the hopes of millions of New Yorkers. Limited by law to two terms and showing no interest so far in higher office, he can spend the next four years building his legacy. For an example of how a chief executive can fritter away a final term, Mr. Bloomberg needs only to look to Albany and the wheel-spinning of the state's lame-duck governor, George Pataki. Mr. Bloomberg has always treated Mr. Pataki with great respect, but the time for deference is over. The mayor has already moved to take more control over the stalled redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. The state should also be pressed hard either to fix its Medicaid program or to stop making localities pay such a big share of the bill for its mismanagement.

By the end of the day, only 53 remained in custody; the police said 5 were members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam guerrilla group. The rest, charged with minor crimes, were released on bail.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Legacies They Left;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;News;Elsie Owens Fighting for civil rights and health care When Elsie Owens moved her family from the Bronx to Gordon Heights in the Town of Brookhaven in 1959, she had such high hopes of giving her children a chance at a better life that she was not put off by the lack of streetlights, the unpaved roads or the absence of public water. At least not at first. But within a year, her civic activism kicked in and she began what would become a lifelong fight for her civil rights and those of her neighbors.

She wanted Benjamin, now 7, to experience eating as a shared social event, rather than an isolating one in which he pulled his own treat out of a baggie while the other children gobbled dessert together.

Van Wyck was unceremoniously inaugurated as the first mayor of the consolidated city of Greater New York. He did not deliver an inaugural address. Instead, after inspecting several floral displays in the mayor's private office, Mr. Van Wyck accepted the congratulations of the departing mayor, William L. Strong -- who observed that the voters had decided that Mr. Van Wyck should ''descend from your position as judge and assume the position of magistrate'' -- and then replied tartly: ''Mr. Mayor, the people have chosen me to be mayor. I shall say whatever I have to say to them.''

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; FILM;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;The animation expert Greg Ford has put together a rousing program, CARTOON MUSICALS, that continues through Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater (www.filmlinc.com). Sunday brings Loony Esoterica and Merrie Marginalia, devoted to shorts with musical themes from the Warner Brothers cartoon studios. The great Carl Stalling was in charge of the musical elements, underlining the work of Bugs Bunny and associates with his highly distinctive musical cues and sly, punning references to pop hits in the Warner catalog. Showing Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 1 and 6:45 p.m. and Wednesday at 2:45 p.m., the program includes a typically elegant Friz Freleng study in musical synchronization, ''Stage Door Cartoon'' (1944), plus work by the directors Frank Tashlin (''Wholly Smoke''), Robert Clampett (''Naughty Neighbors'' and ''Polar Pals'') and Mr. Ford himself (''Blooper Bunny,'' with Terry Lennon as co-director). A program of George Pal's Puppetoons (Sunday at 4:15 p.m., Monday at 3:15 and Wednesday at 1 p.m. ) brings together some of the extremely polished stop-motion animation produced by Pal, including ''Rhapsody in Wood'' (1947), with music by Woody Herman's big band, and ''A Date With Duke'' (1947), set to an Ellington score. The shorts in Independently Musical (Sunday at 6 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 p.m.) come from outside the studio environment and include George Griffin's free-form illustration of a Charlie Parker solo, ''Koko'' (1988). The nonrepresentational work of the German-born Oskar Fischinger has proved to be immensely influential, casting its throbbing, geometric spell on films from Walt Disney's ''Fantasia'' to Stanley Kubrick's ''2001.'' Optical Etudes (Monday at 5 and 9 p.m.) brings together 20 of Fischinger's own short films. Frequently set to classical music, Fischinger's films of the 30's and 40's invite comparison to the fine art products of their day with titles like ''Study No. 7'' and ''Motion Painting No. 1.''

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Up Front;Book Review editors introduce Special Issue dedicated to Literary Lives (S);Book Review Desk;article;News;''It is often said that one has but one life to live, but that is nonsense,'' Louis L'Amour, the master of the cowboy shoot-'em-up, wrote. ''For one who reads, there is no limit to the number of lives that may be lived.'' That's pretty corny. It also happens to be true, as this issue, a look at nine very different literary lives, proves. L'Amour, if he were still around, might have paid special attention to the multiple lives led by his fellow writer of westerns, Zane Grey. (As Jonathan Miles notes in his review of a new biography, Grey's wholesome image is being peppered with buckshot.) Also reviewed here are new biographies of writers who led lives of terrific drama -- including Siegfried Sassoon, who fought heroically in World War I -- and those, like Franz Kafka and Katherine Anne Porter, whose lives off the page burned with a quieter intensity. Most of the writers under discussion here are long dead. The exception is Sidney Sheldon, about whom Jane and Michael Stern write: ''With a novel, a play and another nonfiction book now in the works, who knows where the amazing career of this 88-year-old prodigy will head?''

Recession. Gulf war imminent. In keeping with the shaky global mood, I haven't a clue what to do with my life. So I decide to move to Japan to teach the only thing I can confidently claim to know after four years of college: English. In America, I reason, the only thing more shameful than not knowing what you want is knowing, with absolute certainty, that stuffed animals turn you on. In Japan I'll be immersed in a culture that nurtures uncertainty as a form of enlightenment. I remind myself of the Zen-like quotation ''Emotional freedom comes with being aware of the certainty of uncertainty.'' I will go to Japan, I will be certainly uncertain and I will reach a higher plane of existence while eating amazing food.

The Great Neck restaurant has been a favorite since 1987, serving kosher Persian food to the Iranian Jews in that community and to lovers of good Middle Eastern food from across the Island. Now there is another Colbeh on the Island, in Roslyn Estates. (There are two others in the city: one in Flushing, Queens; another in Manhattan.) The newest Colbeh has taken over the quaint cottage that generations of Long Islanders knew as the Wee Tappee Inn. More recently, it was the elegant Ruby Room and the equally good-looking Lisenda.

Federal District Judge Richard C. Casey in Manhattan ruled last week that Mr. Stallone could continue to use ''Sly'' as the name of his new magazine for middle-aged fitness buffs. An Internet magazine with the same name had challenged his right to ''Sly,'' which is also Mr. Stallone's nickname. But the judge ruled that there is little chance anyone would confuse his fitness magazine, which is published by American Media, and the Webzine, which specializes in women's shoes and accessories.

Walking to work on frigid mornings during the transit strike brought this question to mind: Just how cold can it get in New York, anyway? A. Pretty nippy. On Friday, Feb. 9, 1934, at 7:25 a.m., the temperature dropped to minus 14.3 degrees Fahrenheit, the coldest day on record. Todd Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, says that the cause was probably a mass of Arctic air, carried south by the jet stream. The temperature never rose above 7 that day.

What he hears, most of all, is the story of the workers who built brownstone Brooklyn and whose successors are filling the streets of gentrifying neighborhoods like Boerum Hill with the buzzing of saws and the banging of hammers. Those sounds are unlikely to subside anytime soon, even as the real estate market is expected to retreat from the boom-and-bust cycles of the past few years.

AUSTIN CONSIDINE SAIL AROUND THE WORLD Jules Verne's heroes did it in 80 days.

The longest trip offered is offered by Cunard Line (800-728-6273, www.cunard.com), on the Queen Elizabeth 2, which makes its 109-day journey from, and returning to, New York, departing Jan. 9, and making stops in places like Alexandria, Egypt, and Fuerte Amador, Panama, along the way.

I liked organizing and putting things together: keeping journals or planning outings or just pulling together a group to play ball after school or on weekends. When I was a teenager, a group of my friends from East Meadow, Long Island, my hometown, and I would go into New York to see a Knicks or a Rangers game or just to spend the day. I was always the one who got the tickets, pulled together the train schedule and recommended where to eat.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Army, Faced With Its Limits;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;ONE million men and women serve in the United States Army, so why is it proving nearly impossible to keep a mere 150,000 of them in Iraq? The Pentagon expects to face many Iraq-type conflicts in the coming years, wars that involve battling insurgents and restoring stability. As a result, a debate is beginning to churn in defense policy circles: Should the government enlarge the military so it can more easily fight these wars? Or should the government alter its policies, so as not to fight such wars as often, at least not alone?

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Can You Revive an Extinct Animal?;D T Max profiles maverick South African taxidermist Reinhold Rau and his project of trying to revive extinct animal, a quagga, last seen at end of 19th century; he claims he is on verge of breeding it back to life; photos (L);Magazine;article;News;Reinhold Rau is one of the last of his breed. He was once part of a team of seven taxidermists who, during the apartheid years in South Africa, mounted mammals and birds for the natural-history museum in Cape Town. You can still see his work there. The leopard moving toward its prey on the third floor is Rau's creation, as is the zebra fawn in a nearby glass case, taking shelter under an adult. Rau loves his work -- the stripping of the animal's skin from the body, the construction of the mold that replaces its flesh, the sleight of hand that brings about a permanent version of the animal's old self. ''Sometimes when the schoolchildren come and see taxidermy, they almost faint,'' he told me recently in his accented English (he grew up in Germany). ''But it never had that effect on me.''

Now, at the new club Tao Las Vegas, New York class meets Vegas flash. On a Saturday night in December hundreds of people stood in line to enter the four-level club. ''It's been a long time since I've been to a big club like this,'' said Joy Bryant, an actress who stars with 50 Cent in ''Get Rich or Die Tryin'.'' As her friends danced to ''Sweet Child o' Mine,'' by Guns N' Roses, she was having a cocktail and gawking at the scene. ''Even though it's so big, each little area feels like its own spot,'' she said. Couples drank in the darkness of the Monk Bar, which has a wall lined with 150 small Buddha figures with candles, while the actor Michael Rapaport and friends took in the house music in the Opium Room. In the V.I.P. area bottles of Cristal adorned with sparklers lighted up customers in plush banquettes. ''I've been to Marquee in New York,'' said Kevin Federline, who was at Tao with friends but without his wife, Britney Spears. ''And this is the upscale of the Marquee in New York.'' (Tao Las Vegas is the offspring of Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, the owners of Marquee, who teamed up with the owners of Tao New York.)
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Last Call;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Op-Ed;FOR the last nine years, the Blind Tiger Ale House on Hudson Street in the West Village was one of the best places for New York's beer lovers to be on New Year's Eve. But last night, its doors were locked. The wee hours of Dec. 29 marked the end of an era -- the last pint was poured at the Tiger. No one knows yet what will take its place, but if the neighborhood trend continues, it will be a high-end retail store, perhaps another Ralph Lauren boutique. The place had been around for only a decade, but in that time it became practically world famous for its beer selection. American microbrews, classic Belgians and a selection of others handpicked from around the globe were poured from 24 taps, two handpulls and endless bottles.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; POP/JAZZ;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;What's the difference between a bunch of stylish arrivistes and a bunch of well-loved veterans? In the case of the New York retro-rock band THE STROKES, the difference is about four years. In 2001, the band released ''Is This It'' (RCA), a debut album that helped popularize a musical movement that's now easy to take for granted. It's no longer a surprise to find skinny pants and jagged guitar lines on MTV. And though the Strokes seemed very -- to some listeners, suspiciously -- mediagenic when they arrived, a newer generation of bands has changed that perception, too; for any young, stylish band looking to conquer MTV, THE KILLERS, not the Strokes, are the model of success. The second Strokes album, ''Room on Fire'' (RCA), was in some ways even leaner than the first. While other bands might have chased a fuzzy ideal of creative freedom, the Strokes sounded obsessed with discipline. It seemed as if they could go on forever, releasing short, tight albums full of short, tight songs. On Tuesday, fans will get a chance to find out whether this is, in fact, the plan. In probably the slowest week of the musical year, the Strokes will release ''First Impressions of Earth'' (RCA), which should help determine their place in a rock 'n' roll era that they helped create. The first single, ''Juicebox,'' was accompanied by a video that portrayed a sleazily satirical version of the music industry (there was an already-infamous scene with a small old woman and bigger, younger dog) that was almost guaranteed to be shunned by MTV (and, not coincidentally, celebrated on blogs); there are plenty of worse ways to let people know you have a new album.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Fish That Isn't Post-Holiday Penance;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Review;WITH the indulgence of December recalled only on the waistline, many diners see the first months of the year as a time to abstain from pleasures of the table. Low-carb or low-fat regimens appeal after the season of surfeit, and some holiday celebrants assume that regaining control means dining at home. But seafood restaurants like Eastchester Fish Gourmet can satisfy post-holiday culinary needs with diet-friendly fresh fish. This kitchen lacked some of the polish and care it took with preparations a few years ago, but nothing was amiss with a carpaccio of salmon and tuna, the translucent squares of pale tuna and pink salmon arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Crisp pear, ginger and lime cut deliciously the butteriness of the fish. Perched on a bed of greens and called simply grilled shrimp salad, this item was far removed from the familiar deli item of the same name. Here, a bed of greens made up the salad crowned with five large shrimp -- crisp and rich from a light charring on the grill.

The room was empty, save a gaggle of stunning waitresses -- one of them dressed as a Santa's helper -- and in the final moments of calm before his party started, Mr. Nicolas had to take care of some last communiqués. He checked on the Boca Juniors, an Argentinian soccer team, his favorite; they'd won. He zapped word to a few friends that the party was starting. Good news: they were on the way. Then he took a sip of Champagne and looked around the room intently, the way a painter might gaze at a blank canvas. ''It's all about balance,'' Mr. Nicolas said with the utmost earnestness. ''If there are too many girls, we let in more guys. We don't want that many suits. It's glamorous, but we emphasize the artsy. Whoever is in town is here: Leo, Denzel, Jennifer Lopez, everybody.''

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The House of Time;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Even in a good year, it can seem sometimes as though our days are numbers on a string -- week after week, month after month passing in a straight chronological line through our allotted age. At times like that it feels as though we were living by the calendar astronomers sometimes use, by which today is the Julian day 2453737. To envision today as 2453737 instead of Jan. 1, 2006, is to grasp immediately how welcoming, how comforting the cyclical nature of our lives really is. Our house of time is a circular one, full of familiar landmarks that we commemorate year after year as they come in sight again. It is always surprising how refreshing it is to come upon New Year, how vital the idea of starting over always is. Of course there is no starting over, not really. But the promise of the new year is not merely a metaphor or a delusion. We are creatures bound by our habitation on this planet to live by the inevitable circularities of light and season, no matter how abstracted or urbane our lives have become. And we are no less habituated to the cycles of promise and renewal. To live without a sense of promise is barely to live at all.

The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the passing of its great Trustee John Parkinson. John, who enjoyed a long and successful career as a banker, joined the MoMA Board of Trustees in 1976. For almost thirty years John served brilliantly in varying capacities as the Museum's Treasurer, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman of the Pension Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Photography, and served as a member on many other trustee committees including the Expansion, Executive, Personnel, House, Investment, and Nominating committees. Since 1966 John was a member of the Museum's International Council and served as its Treasurer from 1973 to 1978. From 1970 onward, his generosity enabled the acquisition of scores of important photographs for the collection. John's relationship to the Museum reached back to its creation, as his mother, Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, also a Trustee, was the niece of Lillie P. Bliss, one of the Museum's original founders. The Trustees and staff are profoundly grateful for John's extraordinary contribution to the life of the Museum and will remember him with affection and high regard as a great leader, a true gentleman, and a stalwart defender of the Museum's ideals. We will miss him deeply and extend our sympathies to his wife Charlotte, their children Elizabeth, John and Allston and all members of the Parkinson family.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; CLASSICAL MUSIC;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;Symphony Space is trying to become a hotbed of contemporary classical music. On Thursday night, for example, the YING QUARTET, a dynamic ensemble of young sibling string players, in the midst of its fifth and last season in residence, presents an adventurous program. The concert stands out all the more because the first week of January is typically a slow time in the classical music season. The quartet will present the New York premiere of TOD MACHOVER's '' but not simpler ,'' which alternates movements played traditionally with electronically generated interludes. Though Mr. Machover, a professor of music and media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a sophisticated knowledge of electronic resources, he brings a childlike enthusiasm to his multimedia experiments. The Ying Quartet's eclectic program will include works by ELLIOTT CARTER, the Renaissance master William Byrd, Beethoven, the Beatles and that pioneer of musical invention and experimental instruments, JOHN CAGE. 7:30 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. If this concert sounds too out there, , you can always try the Metropolitan Opera's candy-store-colored production of Donizetti's comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which opens on Monday night. The delightful story concerns a painfully shy Tuscan village bumpkin who overcomes his romantic timidity thanks to a roving quack, who sells him a miracle love potion (actually just a bottle of wine). The cast stars the ardent tenor RAMÓN VARGAS and the golden-voiced soprano RUTH ANN SWENSON. The show may not be cutting edge, but it should be enjoyable. Monday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 1:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Movies;None;Television;article;News;MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004) Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 4:10 a.m. on HBO. It won the Oscars for best actress (Hilary Swank, her second in this category), best supporting actor (Morgan Freeman), best director (Clint Eastwood, above, with Ms. Swank) and best picture. This is just an old-fashioned boxing movie about a talented young fighter with superhuman determination and a crusty old trainer with better things to do. But there are a few significant differences: The young boxer is a woman. The plot forces audiences to face the existence of random tragedy. And the ending turns into a comment on a controversial social issue. Whose life is it anyway? SPIRITED AWAY (2001) Thursday at 8 p.m. on TCM. This is the English-language version of Hayao Miyazaki's terrific anime fantasy. Daveigh Chase does the voice of Chihiro (below), a skinny 10-year-old girl who wanders through what looks like an abandoned theme park but turns out to be a strange and terrifying world (actually a bathhouse for spirits). Jason Marsden is the voice of Haku, a boy with magical powers who helps her navigate the place, at first. And that's Suzanne Pleshette speaking for Yubaba, the frightening, big-headed, beringed, red-talon-nailed creature who runs the place. None of this would have happened if Chihiro's parents, on the way to their new home, hadn't decided to take a short cut. DIE MOMMIE DIE! (2003) Sunday at 10:30 p.m. on Sundance. ''Far From Heaven'' may have been the decade's most satisfying homage to 1950's Technicolor melodramas so far, but it didn't have a drag queen in the lead. In this spoof-homage, the incomparable Charles Busch stars as Angela Arden (and her dead sister, Barbara), a washed-up singer with a personality somewhere between Joan Crawford's and Lana Turner's. Angela is living in Hollywood with her memories, her despised husband, her messed-up teenage children and sometimes her younger-man lover (Jason Priestley, above, with Mr. Busch), who also has an eye for Angela's daughter and her son. The plot involves arsenic, a mob debt, a devoted Bible-quoting housekeeper and a wicked LSD trip. Mark Rucker directed, hilariously. THE HARMONISTS (1998) Tuesday at 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. on IFC. The Comedian Harmonists were a real singing group in Germany in the 1930's -- a wildly popular barbershop sextet -- and the performances heard in this stylish, atmospheric film are by the real Comedian Harmonists. The music is half the joy here, but the story is also personal and political. Harry Frommermann (played by Ulrich Noethen, second from front) put the group together in Berlin, but during its first American engagement, he is ready to move here. Back home, Hitler is in power (three of the Harmonists are Jewish). Joseph Vilsmaier directed and almost, but not quite, makes the standing ovation at the group's farewell performance believable.

Twenty minutes later, having made friends with the elegant Burberry-clad woman from Barcelona seated next to me, I was happy I had taken the waiter's advice to have it grilled, rather than steamed or pan-fried. My fish arrived lightly crisp on the outside and beautifully flaky on the inside, stuffed with lemon slices and thyme. ''Whenever I come to London this is always my first stop,'' said my Spanish neighbor, savoring a taste of her bouillabaisse. ''And then I shop!''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Act II: American Racial History Plays in London;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;FOR years, Eugene O'Neill's ''Emperor Jones'' has usually been looked upon with a wince. It is as if this stark psychological parable from 1920, which charts the degeneration of a self-appointed black emperor from regal swagger into primal fear, were some formerly famous, deeply embarrassing old relative -- the kind you introduce into polite company only with winks and mouthed apologies behind his back. But the United Kingdom, whatever its official immigration policy, has a way of taking in and rehabilitating the cultural castoffs of the American theater, especially difficult or ostensibly lesser works by masters like O'Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. Now a small London company called the Gate has wrapped the unloved ''Emperor Jones'' in a bear hug of a production that allows no room for protective self-consciousness or irony. The results have left audiences and critics dazed, disturbed and gasping for superlatives.

Only the visitors to the model train layout in the basement of Sean Fanelli's Garden City home had to watch their step so as not to trip over the miniature smoke-puffing locomotive that clickety-clacked along the track set up on the floor, accompanied by announcements from a computer-chip soundtrack.

He was raised in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan and lived much of his life in Roosevelt, N.J., but after he moved he still came back to New York often. Sometimes, with one of his three daughters in tow, he would have lunch with his agent or his publisher. Other times, he would come alone to walk the streets, stand on the docks and check the myriad visual details that would fill his novels and become the settings and backgrounds for his characters' bitter and desperate lives.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   ADAMS, RUTH, M.D.;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;ADAMS--Ruth, M.D. Of Oakland, California, died on December 16, 2005 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland. She was 88 years old. Born June 12, 1917 in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of George Dana Adams and Pearl (Bittle), Ruth grew up in the Cleveland area. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1939, and worked at Wellesley College and at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She also took flying lessons and earned her pilot's license. During World War II, Ruth applied to and was accepted into Class 44-W-2 of the W.A.S.P. (Women Airforce Service Pilots) program. She flew fighter planes across the United States mainland until the end of the War. She then put herself through New York Medical College and completed a residency in psychiatry. She continued her studies in psychiatry at the William Alanson White Psychiatric Institute in New York City. She developed a private practice in New York City and served as psychiatrist for the Youth Authority of the City of New York. Dr. Adams moved to California in the early 1970's, where her sister Margaret Adams Schmidt and family lived. Both Margaret Schmidt and Ruth's younger sister, Jeanne Adams, predeceased her. Settling in Oakland, Ruth served as a psychiatrist for the Alameda County emergency juvenile psychiatric facility until her retirement in 1988. Dr. Adams died at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, four weeks after a massive stroke. She is survived by her cousin, Elizabeth Crahan of Elk, CA, her niece Margaret Miller and her nephews John Acker, Steven Acker, and Charles Acker, of Elk, CA. Memorial contributions may be made to Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College, 106 Center St., Wellesley, MA 02481. A memorial gathering is being planned.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Not Just Another Half-Dozen Pretty, Floating Faces;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;SINCE the dawn of film marketing, studios have relied on posters featuring ''floating heads'': as many movie star faces as can be crammed onto a single page. In 1927, for instance, state-of-the-art ads for ''The Jazz Singer'' featured two disembodied Al Jolson heads -- one in blackface, one without makeup. Since then floating heads have become an industry cliché: the formula that once guaranteed success is now so ubiquitous that posters in that vein are nearly invisible. So what does it take to get noticed some 80 years later, especially when you're selling yet another horror film, without the luxury of big stars?
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Why Not, Indeed;None;New Jersey Weekly Desk;article;Review;IF ''A'' is for attitude, it's a grade that Bernard Vard's little bistro has richly earned. Not as in cheeky or patronizing, but as in friendly, honest and unassuming to a fault. The other day, I asked Mr. Vard about his restaurant's mouthful of a name, with its internal punctuation and shifting parts of speech. He explained that ''Pourquoi Pas?'' -- meaning ''Why not?'' of course, and carried over from his previous venture, in Ho Ho Kus -- was a name he'd borrowed decades ago from an inn in the south of France. A modest workingman, the son of an Auvergne butcher, he never wanted to be part of a ''Chez Bernard.''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Novel Thinking As a Survival Tactic;Excerpts from conversation with Vijay Govindarajan, professor of international business at Dartmouth, on importance of break-through innovations to US economy and role of chief executive officers in building capacity to innovate; drawing (M);Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;Interview;LARGE American companies, not just small start-ups, are capable of breakthrough innovations, says Vijay Govindarajan, professor of international business at Dartmouth. He is co-author, with Chris Trimble, of ''10 Rules for Strategic Innovators: From Idea to Execution,'' (Harvard Business School Press, 2005, $29.95). Here are excerpts from a conversation: Q. Why is the subject of innovation so hot these days? A. In the 1990's, people were just rolling the dice and spending billions of dollars. It was reckless innovation. Post-9/11 and the dot-com bursting, people went back to cost-cutting. But now they also said, ''After Act I is over, we must create growth and innovation.'' This time, they're saying, ''We want to grow, but minimize risks and grow profitably.'' Innovation has come back with a different twist. It's very much on the agenda of chief executive officers. Without growth and innovation, organizations die. Q. Is this fascination with innovation being driven by the emergence of new competitors from China and India? A. The emergence of India and China has made innovation extremely critical. Together they are about $2 trillion in gross domestic product. That's only 5 percent of the world's G.D.P. But if these two economies grow at the rate at which the World Bank and Goldman Sachs predict, then tens of trillions of dollars worth of economic activity will be created in the next 25 years. Q. Are larger companies a more important source of American innovation than smaller ones? A. I would not say it is ''either'' or ''or.'' We need small start-ups to continue the innovation stream. But I believe that only large companies like General Electric can solve big, complex problems, which can make a huge difference to humanity. Q. Which are the most innovative large companies today? A. There is no perfect example. G.E., eBay, Johnson & Johnson and 3M come to mind. This is a topic that almost every company is concerned about. When you are a large, established, tradition-bound company, to fundamentally innovate, it's not in your genes. Fundamental innovation implies that you have to selectively forget some of the things you're doing well today. That's not so easy. Q. You say that Apple is among the best innovators in the technology world. Which other companies belong on that list? A. Motorola. They stumbled in the 90's and missed the boat on several things. But in the past three or four years, it has regained its dominant position. A third company is Google. Some people said it was just a fad and would disappear. But they have created a whole new space and continue to change the rules of the game. Q. The largest 500 companies in the country have been net shedders of jobs. Shouldn't they be considered consolidators, not innovators? A. Yes and no. It is true that if you look at Fortune 500 companies, many of them have focused on cost-cutting, re-engineering and restructuring, all of which means shedding jobs. It will be a real shame if companies go bankrupt because they just simply shed jobs. The question is, how do we stop it? They have a lot of capabilities. We as a country must help these companies to maintain an innovative spirit. Q. Say I'm the chief executive of a major company. Is there a secret to achieving innovation in my company? A. First, strategic innovation is critical for you. Don't ignore it. In addition to continuous process improvement, focus on strategic innovation. Secondly, coming up with a new idea is only the starting point. You need to pay attention to execution of the idea. Q. What else do I need to do? A. You must be able to forget some of the success formula by which you are succeeding today. By definition, that's irrelevant. Secondly, you must be able to borrow one or two of the core assets of your company and lend them to the new idea. Q. What's the final part of the challenge? A. The new venture must learn to resolve uncertainties. There are always questions about the size of the market, what the customer needs, what the technology solutions are -- these are always unknown. It's the person who resolves the uncertainties and learns the fastest who will win. Q. Exactly who should manage the hot new idea? A. You must hire an outsider to run the breakthrough idea because insiders are always wedded to orthodoxy and the inside success formula. You must also hire liberally from outside. Hiring from within kills breakthrough innovation. And the business should report to the C.E.O. even if it is very small. It must get the same organizational status as other business units or it is going to be suffocated. Q. So would you say the chief executive has an important role in making breakthrough innovation possible? A. A tremendously important role. I consider the C.E.O.'s role in the modern corporation to be building the capacity to continuously innovate in a breakthrough way. The C.E.O. doesn't create the strategy, but should be listening to the voices of people who are able to see the future. It is the role of the C.E.O. to spot and encourage them. Then, once an idea has promise, you must help build a separate organization around that person.

Until I saw things firsthand, I couldn't believe the scope and intensity of the hurricane's destructive path. It explains why some local community decisions about whether to rebuild are still up in the air.

And they envision people -- thousands of people -- flocking to a revitalized city better known these days for its downtown development and declining crime rate than for its years of urban blight. The hope for a population boom has been so great that Mayor Anthony A. Williams has often predicted that the city will add 100,000 residents by 2010.

In a meeting that was broadcast live, lawmakers excoriated Mr. Khaddam for insulting Syrian pride and accused him of corruption and treason. Even his decision to live in France since his forced resignation six months ago drew cries of betrayal. ''You don't deserve to be a Syrian,'' one lawmaker called out.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Here's Looking at You, Kids;Dress Mirror, mirror shaped like A-line dress on hanger, is available at Conran Shop (S);Style Desk;article;News;For some deep New Year's Day reflections girls of all ages may enjoy the Dress Mirror, artfully designed to hang on a wall. It is made in Belgium and shaped like a sleeveless, A-line dress. At 24 inches wide and 42 inches long, the mirror ($325 at the Conran Shop, 866-755-9079) is just shy of full-length for adults but ample for the younger set. It comes with a beechwood hanger, so it can be slung over any closet rod or wall hook. If hung outside the closet, it can do double duty as a piece of whimsical art, but be sure to hang it opposite something or someone you want to look at for a long time. MARIANNE ROHRLICH

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Why Slave-Era Barriers to Black Literacy Still Matter;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Those of us who write about our families inevitably engage in conversations with the dead. The two specters who take up most of my time these days were black, slave-era founders of the Staples family line. My great-grandfather John Wesley Staples, of whom I have often written, was conceived in the waning days of the Civil War, narrowly missed being born a slave and died just 11 years before my birth. His mother, Somerville Staples, was enslaved in the home of a prominent Virginia doctor when she became pregnant with John Wesley, her last child and the first freeborn member of the Staples clan. My great-grandfather and his mother were barely visible against the backdrop of the 19th-century South when I first started to focus on them about 15 years ago. Since then, the outlines of their lives have become steadily clearer, thanks to remembrances from elderly relatives and documents that have recently turned up in the public record. It will take years, perhaps even decades, to flesh them out fully. But it is already clear that their 21st-century descendants stand heavily in their debt and that my career as a writer would have been much less likely -- and perhaps even impossible -- without them.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;State of the Art;Daniel Kunitz letter disagrees with Barry Gewen Dec 11 (2005) essay;Book Review Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor Bravo to Barry Gewen for his essay ''State of the Art'' (Dec. 11), the single most lucid and evenhanded appraisal of the current ''art'' scene, its critics and proponents, to be found in a long time. How comforting to know that one isn't alone in appalled reaction to the acolytes of the ''anything goes'' school that currently dominates the galleries (and auction houses). Since the moment I saw Oldenburg's plastic toilet seat hanging from the ceiling at MoMA's premiere exhibition of Op and Pop Art in the late 60's, it's been an uphill battle to keep an open mind. By the time Damien Hirst's cow in formaldehyde made headlines, tolerance was fast disappearing. It came to a full stop when reading about the artist who spread his sperm on the pages of a book as part of his exhibit. How lovely to read those words, ''but is it art?''

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;New Releases To Begin A New Year;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;Review;SINCE the glass-is-half-full crowd thinks the new year invariably brings sky-high opportunities, it may be fitting to begin 2006 with Himmel, a Martha Clara dessert wine. The name, which is German, translates as heaven. It also alludes to the German descent of Robert Entenmann, an owner of Martha Clara. This powerful, succulent 2004 North Fork white ($30.99 for a half-bottle), an ice wine made of frozen riesling and gewürztraminer grapes, is not wholly for the drinker with a sweet tooth. Rather, it has an interesting dry-and-sweet interplay that provokes and satisfies the taste buds while caressing the palate.

Corzine is, no one now living can remember it. The governor-elect did not even take the usual fourth-grade field trip here, since he was living in Willey's Station, Ill., at the time. Trenton is not a satellite city like Springfield, in Mr. Corzine's home state, or Albany, N.Y., or Harrisburg, Pa.; despite its tatty appearance, it is a state capital that actually runs the state, and almost anyone who is important in New Jersey eventually shows up to ask for something. This governor's office is the most powerful in the nation. People who work here feel that they are entitled to say yes or no, and they are probably right.

The restaurant's owners, Joseph and John Cotellessa, said their own bills had risen because of fuel surcharges. That, coupled with increased natural gas rates and decreased business in the winter season, led them to start passing on the increases to customers in October.

(Practical Traveler, Dec. 11), the description of the American Express Delta SkyMiles frequent flier program simply does not jibe with my experiences. To start with, your assertion that Delta has many overseas partners, such as KLM, is only 75 percent true. When I tried to use this option with my 50,000 miles this summer, I was told all overseas partners had blacked out their entire summer to Delta. So, what should have been an easy, eight-hour trip from Boston to Paris on Air France turned into a 20-hour ordeal that had me going from Boston to La Guardia, over to John F. Kennedy, and then to Paris.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Bar Of Stiff Drinks Shakes Up A Cocktail Mix;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;News;AFTER a few too many flutes of Champagne and a long night in a haze of crowded bars, another round of drinks may be the last thing running through hangover-clouded minds this morning. But once the fog clears, at least one neighborhood fixture in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, is hoping for a second look. The bar, at Court Street and Fourth Place and now known as P. J. Hanley's, opened in 1881, selling stiff drinks to workingmen who wanted to get drunk fast. For its first century, and a couple of decades more, even as the faces changed, the broad-shouldered toughness of the docks nearby was a constant. But with demographic changes and a new owner at the helm, the old bar finds itself in a tricky and unfamiliar position: It must attract new customers, ideally without driving away the old ones.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;When Pictures Lie, And We Gladly Believe;None;Connecticut Weekly Desk;article;Review;WHEN modern art first arrived en masse in America, back in 1913, with the Armory Show in New York, many of the artists were decried as lying dirty tricksters. Those young Europeans called it art, but American critics and the public thought it was just nonsense. Every generation of artists has its own avant-garde, even if the historical notion of an avant-garde as an oppositional force against an entrenched orthodoxy is no longer applicable; the uncritical absorption of most contemporary art into the mainstream scene has meant, in effect, that the once oppositional has become the establishment.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;State of the Art;Nancy Rogers Yaeger letter comments on Barry Gewen Dec 11 (2005) essay on contemporary art scene;Book Review Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: Barry Gewen's cry of impassioned ignorance reads like something that's been moldering in a drawer for decades. In order to answer the oh-so penetrating and insightful question, ''Has the art world gone crazy?,'' he adduces a 30-year-old performance piece and goes on to attack several middle-aged performance artists -- hardly exemplars of contemporary art. He tells us that contemporary art's ''severest opponents . . . come not from outside the art world but from its very heart.'' His heart (or did he mean heart-attack candidates?) consists of Donald Kuspit, Michael Fried, Harold Rosenberg and Hilton Kramer. Rosenberg died in 1978! The others all fought their battles in the 60's and 70's. He goes on to claim that a 38-year-old essay by Michael Fried is ''required reading for anyone interested in contemporary aesthetic issues.'' I'm a great fan of Fried's essay, but it has little to do with contemporary art. The books Gewen discusses, like the arguments he rehashes, focus on a past that has little to do with today's art world. The figures he points to could be the grandfathers of those making important contemporary art today.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Texas Rap, Made of Pride and Fire;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;The Mississippi rapper and producer David Banner released his third major-label album, ''Certified'' (SRC/Universal), in September. He spoke recently with Joel Topcik about what he's listening to and why: Bun B The rap duo UGK (Underground Kingz), from Port Arthur, Tex., were pioneers that a lot of kids from the South like me looked up to but that never got their proper shine. They've been around for well over 10 years; they were on Jay-Z's ''Big Pimpin' '' in 1999 and all of a sudden the world was acting like they were a new group. I'm proud to see Bun B, half of the duo, carrying the torch with his album ''Trill'' (Rap-a-Lot). You get that Texas sound, the Southern pride in the lyrics, especially on a song like ''Draped Up.'' It has grungy beats with a vocal sample from the legendary Texas rapper Lil' Keke, and Bun B just spits flames over it. Eurythmics Listening to the new Eurythmics compilation, ''The Ultimate Collection'' (Arista), brought back a lot of memories of growing up and hearing them and other acts we all saw on MTV and ''Video Jukebox'' -- the Police, A-Ha, Pat Benatar. But it's not just nostalgia; songs like ''Here Comes the Rain Again'' and ''Sweet Dreams'' are classics. I tried to sample ''Sweet Dreams,'' but the band didn't clear it. That's business; it's their choice, and I'm still a fan. But it reminds me that as a producer, it's important for kids now to know where the samples they're listening to came from. Alicia Keys Some people listen to ''unplugged'' albums looking for a flaw in the music. When I listen, I'm looking for a person's ability to recreate the way they felt when they wrote a particular song or when they recorded it or when they were going through the emotion behind it. When you're unplugged, it's about your spirit, your willingness to make a mistake and let it all out. I hear all that on ''Alicia Keys Unplugged'' (J). It shows her pure talent, vocally and in terms of musicianship. And then there's the fact that it's jammin'. Let's just say that about Alicia Keys: she's talented and jammin'. Grout I was at a concert recently sponsored by the Atlanta rock station 99X, and I saw a local rock group called Grout. One of the problems I have with a lot of young R&B and rock groups is their lack of lyricism. For me it's all about evoking emotion. When I heard Grout, I was impressed with the singer; I could hear the pain and sincerity in his voice, and the depth in the lyrics. It reminded me of the first time I heard Kurt Cobain. I've heard they're in the studio and shopping for a label. Penelope I heard a demo by a rapper named Penelope while I was working in the studio. She's out of St. Louis and is about to release an album on Universal early this year. I think she's going to be the next female voice in rap. She's lived what she's speaking about -- things she's been through on the streets, the struggles of urban life. Some artists are either very street or very commercial, and she has a little of both: street cuts as well as ones that cross over to radio. It's a good time for St. Louis thanks to the doors that Nelly and Chingy and J-Kwon were able to open. There's a swing and a swagger to St. Louis rap, and Penelope definitely has that. Scar This is a young R&B singer from Mississippi who Big Boi from OutKast signed to his label, Purple Ribbon. I heard him recently when I started doing work in Big Boi's studio in Atlanta, and you can hear him on ''Big Boi Presents Got Purp? Vol. 2,'' the new compilation that Virgin put out last month. He and Big Boi do a song called ''U Got Me.'' This dude has so much soul; you can't believe he's only 21, 22 years old. And the lyricism is there. You'd think he was a young Curtis Mayfield.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Down Another Track;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;Editorial;The East End is where Long Island's immense river of cars and trains turns into a pair of trickling tributaries, choked to chronic inefficiency in that narrow, remote terrain. Everybody who lives here knows this; the question is what to do about it, besides kvetching and setting aside ever more time to drive to the ferry, beach or hardware store. Fixing the problem has been a low priority for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Long Island Rail Road, which have their eyes focused on bustling hubs like Hicksville and Jamaica. The M.T.A., after all, is the agency that wanted to ease its budget problems by lopping off extremities like the Greenport line. And with only a handful of trains serving the South and North Forks each day, the railroad seems to treat the area more like an obligation than an opportunity.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Two Rivers and a World Within;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;News;THE HUDSON: A History By Tom Lewis Yale University Press ($30, hardcover) At the end of August 1904, after an absence of more than two decades while he was in Europe, Henry James returned to America. He wanted to see American life, he said, to taste American air, to see old friends, and he knew that at 61, overweight and suffering from occasional bouts of gout, it would likely be his last trip to his birthplace, New York City. The westward passage from Cherbourg had taken just five and a half days. As he surveyed the skyline of New York from the deck of the Kaiser Wilhelm II at its pier at Hoboken, James saw a metropolis transformed. He had left a city of 2 million people and returned to one of 3.6 million, of whom about 1.3 million were foreign-born.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Making Poverty History in 2006;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;It was a banner year in 2005 for big speeches from global leaders about fighting third-world poverty. But if any of their promises are going to come close to being kept, 2006 must be a year of action. The British prime minister, Tony Blair, called Africa's poverty ''the fundamental moral challenge of our generation.'' The United Nations' secretary general, Kofi Annan, spoke of a generation that could make poverty history. President Bush twice stood on the world stage and promised to sharply increase development assistance to poor nations. He did it first at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland in July, when he pledged to double aid to Africa by 2010. He did it again two months later, at a United Nations meeting in New York, where he urged that the ''Monterrey Consensus,'' which calls on rich countries to increase their spending on development aid to 0.7 percent of gross national product, be put into effect.

The other reporters in the media encampment were generally better equipped; most of them had laptops, and Channel 4 even had a little snack buffet. But at 1:28 that groggy Tuesday morning, it was Mr. Cuza, a reporter for NY1 News, the city's round-the-clock local cable channel, who broke the strike story, thanks to tips he had gotten from sources inside the union.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Don't Worry, He's Vegetarian;None;Connecticut Weekly Desk;article;News;HE weighs in at over 7,300 pounds, and reaches up two stories, to peer down on Whitney Avenue in New Haven from a granite perch. He is a rendering of a torosaurus, a horned dinosaur, anchored on the front lawn of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History since October. Designed by Michael Anderson, right, and other artists and scientists, the sculpture is a life-sized three-dimensional image of a dinosaur not seen since the end of the Cretaceous Period 65 million years ago. The torosaurus, a herbivore that fed on low-lying plants, was first identified at the Peabody in the 1890's from fossils found in Wyoming. The concept for the reproduction was proposed in 1999. Because no complete skeleton of the torosaurus has been found, the reproduction was made based on available fossils and on projections made using other fossils, including those of its close relative, the triceratops. A 1/3-scale model was built, and from that a full-sized prototype was made from foam blocks, on which clay would be applied. The clay mold was then used to cast the bronze piece. Texturing the clay on the model to recreate a realistic skin pattern took two dozen workers over five months to complete.

With his jacket unbuttoned and his necktie waving like a flag in the breeze, he marches up and down the sideline, clapping, waving, exhorting. The Pirates (8-3) will be only as good as their defense this season, and they played Iona tight and tough in a nonconference game Saturday, cruising to a 73-59 victory at Continental Arena.

The market is not sizzling hot, at least by comparison to New York and San Francisco in recent years. Still, it is stronger than anyone might reasonably expect four months after Hurricane Katrina, with prices for houses in many areas at or above prestorm levels.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Pleasures Of the Hudson, Even in the Cold;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;News;THERE stood Eddie O'Callaghan, fishing rod in shivering hand, somewhere between rapture and frostbite. He had just threaded onto his hook a bloodworm he had bought at a bait shop on City Island. Wiping his hands with a paper towel, then blowing on them for elusive warmth, he cast out into the Hudson. ''You've got to love it,'' said Mr. O'Callaghan, a native of Ireland. ''You've got to know when you catch the bug.'' The bug and the love, in Mr. O'Callaghan's case, are fishing and the Hudson River. He does one in the other throughout the year, fishing these waters from several favorite spots unless the winter wind is too harsh. When the temperature drops dangerously low, he makes one allowance: running to his car to warm up, until the bell on the line signals a bite.

To cloak the evidence of too much comfort and joy, White & Warren's ruffle-edge cashmere cardigan coat (in camel, chocolate brown and black, $485 at www.whiteandwarren.com) is a good cover-up, an easy-to-wear sweater-jacket that is flattering on all body types and hides a stack of bulges. The cardigan fastens just beneath the breastbone, hits right at the knee and is lightweight enough to fit under a coat without excess bulk. Come spring, it can go it alone.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Counting Graying Heads;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;News;At first glance, the stretch of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that lies a few blocks inland from the water doesn't seem much in need of government assistance. Dignified old apartment buildings and single-family houses with yards and elaborate gates line the quiet streets. On a recent gray afternoon, a car from a driving school inched along as its operator practiced parallel parking. But behind the gates and brick facades there live an unusually high number of elderly people, many of them alone, surviving on fixed incomes, and depending on others to get around. More than 20 percent of Bay Ridge residents are over 60 years old, making Bay Ridge what urban planners call a NORC, a naturally occurring retirement community.

In 2005, they joined humans, chickens and mosquitoes, as well as less famous occupants of the planet, on an exclusive but growing list: organisms whose complete genomes have been sequenced. What would they make of this news, I wonder? Perhaps they would resent the genetic evidence that they are related to us. Or perhaps they would, as I do, revel in being part of the immensity of nature and a product of evolution, the same process that gave rise to dinosaurs, bread molds and myriad organisms too wacky to invent.

Since the war began, 2,178 American service members have been killed. 4 Indictment Demanded in Syria Syria's Parliament called on the government to indict former Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam on treason and corruption charges over his televised criticism of President Bashar al-Assad related to the assassination of Lebanon's former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. 6 Outsourcing Hits Diamond Hub The diamond industry in Antwerp, Belgium, a city that has long been a center for cutting and trading gemstones, is now following the route of many other enterprises in the global market, shifting to the immense reserves of low-cost labor in India. 3 NATIONAL 12-16 Resistance to Spy Program A top Justice Department official objected in 2004 to aspects of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program and refused to sign on to its continued use amid concerns about its legality and oversight, according to officials with knowledge of the tense internal debate. The concerns appear to have played a part in the temporary suspension of the secret program in 2004. 1 Drug Plan Will Bring Delays Millions of older Americans will gain access to government-subsidized prescription drugs with the long-awaited expansion of Medicare. But pharmacists say beneficiaries may initially experience delays and frustration as operational details of the program are adjusted. 1 More Colleges Offer Merit Aid Squeezed between state universities, which charge lower tuitions, and elite private institutions, private liberal arts colleges are routinely offering merit aid to students. 1 Bush Returns to White House After six days of nearly complete isolation on his ranch in Crawford, Tex., President Bush is scheduled to return to the White House and launch into a campaign to set the tone for 2006, and possibly beyond. 13 Drugs May Reduce Suicide Risk Treatment with antidepressant drugs appears to reduce the risk of suicide in depressed teenagers and adults, according to a study published today in The American Journal of Psychiatry. 15 A Call to Raise Salaries Chief Justice John G.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will attempt to buck the trend as he takes the oath of office for a second time. 19 Minimum Wage Rises New York State's minimum wage is set to rise as the second stage of a three-year increase, but the raise has been criticized by business lobbyists as a job destroyer that encourages small businesses to move to nearby states that have lower minimum wages while some workers say that the increase is still not enough to survive in New York. 21 Neediest Cases 24 OBITUARIES 26 Alan M.

In the world of Washington power brokers -- some would say influence peddlers -- his stadium and arena skyboxes were often stages for favors given and returned among lobbyists and legislators. Mr. Abramoff, left, had four skyboxes in the capital area: one each in the MCI Center in Washington and Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and two in FedEx Field, where the Redskins play. His aeries were leased mostly with money from Indian tribe clients, who paid Mr. Abramoff and his partner a total of more than $80 million to influence Congress on matters of casino gambling.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Good Film, Shame About the Helvetica;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' the movie about Edward R. Murrow's battle to expose the demagoguery of Joseph R. McCarthy, has received both critical and popular acclaim. But the movie has its fervent detractors -- and they aren't people nostalgic for the days of backyard fallout shelters. They are typographers and graphic designers. Their charge: typographical inaccuracy. It appears that the CBS News sign, prominently displayed in the film's carefully reconstructed New York newsroom, uses the typeface Helvetica. But Helvetica was not designed until 1957, the year McCarthy died. The movie takes place in the early 1950's.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; TELEVISION;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;Any appearance by DIANE KEATON, Oscar winner and baby-boomer role model, is an event. Of course, Ms. Keaton has done her share of forgettable television movies, but the source material for ''SURRENDER DOROTHY'' (CBS, tonight at 9), MEG WOLITZER's 1999 novel, is promising. Ms. Keaton plays a grieving mother whose only child, Sara (ALEXA DAVALOS), has been killed in a car accident. She turns to Sara's friends, moving in with them at their summer house and becoming especially close to a young gay playwright (TOM EVERETT SCOTT). The theme -- at least in the book -- is family and friends' competing claims on the dead. It's far from a guarantee of success, but the creators of the new NBC series ''FOUR KINGS'' (which has its premiere Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) are DAVID KOHAN and MAX MUTCHNICK, who gave the world the over-the-top, largely lovable characters of ''WILL & GRACE.'' At this point, however, the only clear similarities between the two shows are that they're both set in New York and have four main characters. Josh Cooke plays Ben, a young man with three close male friends ) and a grandmother who has died and left him her amazing Manhattan apartment. This being television, Ben doesn't move in alone or with his girlfriend (Kiele Sanchez). He invites his three guy pals to share the place. At least they have an excuse for living in an apartment so far beyond their means. Inexpensive, often mindless reality series continue to infest prime time, but once in a while the premise is intriguing. MTV's ''X EFFECT,'' which has its premiere on Tuesday night at 10, could be interesting. The show reunites former couples, then watches what happens. This is an emotional dynamic that hasn't been used to death in nonfiction television, unless you count GEORGE and ALANA HAMILTON's talk show.

The meatpacking district is still going strong. Here are some of the newer entries to this culinary playground. DEL POSTO (212) 497-8090; 85 Tenth Avenue (15th Street); $$$; Article: 12/7/05. Del Posto (''Of the Place'') is the latest entry into Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich's restaurant empire, which includes Babbo, Lupa, Esca, Bistro du Vent, Otto, Casa Mono and Bar Jamón. The menu covers lofty terrain: a Barolo risotto and a lobster risotto and a risotto with pumpkin and lardo. FATTY CRAB (212) 352-3590; 643 Hudson Street (Horatio Street): $; $25 and Under: 10/26/05. Zak Pelaccio's rollicking Malaysian roadhouse is done up in dark woods and reds; ornately carved chairs with stiff backs are crammed around small tables that fill the tiny dining room. The signature chili crab consists of a Dungeness crab served in a delicious pool of spicy, crab-drenched sauce with broiled white bread to sop it up. NERO (212) 675-5224; 46 Gansevoort Street (Greenwich Street); $$; Article: 1/5/05. This Italian place opened about a year ago in the space that housed the Moroccan restaurant Zitoune. The menu includes homey dishes like ricotta dumplings with sweet sausage and white beans; and sauteed boneless duck breast with soft polenta and Parmesan dumplings. ONO * [Rating: One Star] (212) 660-6766; Hotel Gansevoort, 18 Ninth Avenue (West 13th Street); $$$$; Review: 2/9/05. Ono serves quasi-Japanese food that has more than a modicum of merit. A highlight of the long menu is skewers of meat, fish or vegetables like Kobe beef, quail and shiitake mushroom, cooked over the restaurant's Japanese-style robata grill. SPICE MARKET * * * [Rating: Three Stars] (212) 675-2322; 403 West 13th Street (Ninth Avenue); $$$; Review: 3/24/04. Jean-Georges Vongerichten has hit on casual, exotic luxury and food that people want to eat. It is Southeast Asian street food, a cuisine regarded by some as the best in the world. Only here it has been reworked and polished. Among the highlights are spring rolls, crunchy squid salad and pork vindaloo. VENTO (212) 699-2400; 675 Hudson Street (14th Street); $$; Diner's Journal: 4/30/04. Vento is Steve Hanson's larger, more casual version of Fiamma Osteria, his three-star Italian restaurant in SoHo. The menu runs roughly parallel to the one at Fiamma, offering a highlight reel of all that is expected of an Italian menu in New York City right now: crudo to begin, some pizza in the middle, or pasta, followed by fish, or pork, or steak.

And I have had unusual difficulty getting a better explanation for readers, despite the paper's repeated pledges of greater transparency. For the first time since I became public editor, the executive editor and the publisher have declined to respond to my requests for information about news-related decision-making. My queries concerned the timing of the exclusive Dec. 16 article about President Bush's secret decision in the months after 9/11 to authorize the warrantless eavesdropping on Americans in the United States.

But in the end, Ms. Mackney said, the decision was simple. Boston, where tuition is now $31,530 a year, offered her no financial aid, while Allegheny awarded her a $50,000 merit scholarship, or $12,500 a year. That amounts to nearly a 50 percent discount of Allegheny's $26,650 tuition.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Spinning Our Wheels;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;Op-Ed;LAST month, during the height of holiday festivities in Manhattan, my husband and I attempted to join a group of 12 people at one of the trendiest, most famous Asian restaurants on the Upper East Side to celebrate a close friend's birthday. Because my husband, Tom, is a 45-year-old quadriplegic (nine months after our wedding 12 years ago, he broke his neck diving into our pool) and confined to a 300-pound electric wheelchair, our friend's wife called the restaurant in advance to ensure that it was fully wheelchair-accessible. The restaurant assured her that it was. However, after driving into Manhattan from our home in the suburbs and arriving at the restaurant, we encountered an unwelcome surprise. There was no elevator, ramp or kitchen access, and the restaurant's staff looked at us dumbfounded and confused.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Smoke Shops Upset With Surveillance;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;News;AFTER about a month of highly visible surveillance by the Suffolk County Police, the tax-free smoke shops on the American Indian reservations of the East End are chafing. Officials say the police are simply after tax evaders and smugglers who buy in bulk for resale. But some smoke shop owners say they think the county's real aim is to shut down the shops, or at least to crimp their business by scaring customers away.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Maybe the Stock Pickers Have Gone Fishing;Mark Hulbert column on study conducted by Indiana University Assoc Prof Utpal Bhattacharya and graduate student Neal Galpin on individual stock picking; graph (M);Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;News;AT the level of investment theory, a debate continues to rage between active stock pickers and those who advocate passive indexing. At the level of everyday practice, however, the debate appears largely over. A new study finds that stock picking accounts for a small and declining proportion of the market's overall trading volume. The study, ''Is Stock Picking Declining Around the World?,'' has been circulating in academic circles as a working paper since late last year. Its authors are Utpal Bhattacharya, an associate professor of finance at Indiana University, and one of his graduate students, Neal Galpin. A version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract--id=849627.

This year, the first time in 28 years of reviewing, I gave no new restaurants an ''Excellent'' rating, the highest in a five-tier scale. But 2005 was not a culinary failure. I rated eight restaurants ''Very Good,'' the second-highest ranking, and rated a number ''Good,'' the middle ranking, with certain dishes that linger tenaciously in my memory.

The Scarlet Knights are off to their best start since the 1982-83 season, and they have a player who can take over a game. When the struggling Princeton Tigers put a scare into Rutgers on Saturday, the junior guard Quincy Douby made sure an upset would not happen. He scored 12 of the team's final 17 points as the Scarlet Knights prevailed, 54-44.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Era of Cable Choice Inches Ever Closer;None;Westchester Weekly Desk;article;News;THE telephone giant Verizon is poised within the next three months to offer cable television service to customers in New York for the first time. The State Public Service Commission, which regulates the cable industry, unanimously approved its first municipal agreement on Dec. 14, paving the way for its expansion plan -- over the objections of Cablevision, its main competitor in the area. The good news for customers is that they will at last have a choice of providers. In fact, completed franchise agreements between Verizon and the Villages of Nyack and South Nyack, in Rockland County, are already pending before the commission.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Gifford Miller's Council;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Editorial;Gifford Miller served for 10 years in the City Council, the last four as its powerful speaker, leading what may have been the most spirited, cantankerous council any New York mayor has ever had to deal with. As a new council prepares to name his successor, Mr. Miller deserves to be remembered for exercising strong and creative leadership at moments when the mayor's executive ambitions needed a restraining hand. Mr. Miller was 32 years old when he stepped into the speaker's chair. His council was a combustible mix of freshly minted public servants and term-limited members -- including Mr. Miller -- who were plotting their next career moves. Even with that distraction, or perhaps because of it, the council passed important legislation.

Sorenstam, hoping for a women's Grand Slam after winning the Kraft Nabisco and the McDonald's L.P.G.A. titles, was never in serious contention in the United States Women's Open. Birdie Kim won by holing a bunker shot. In a Monday finish because of a storm delay, Phil Mickelson chipped out of the rough for a tap-in birdie on the final hole to win the P.G.A. Championship at Baltusrol. Michael Campbell of New Zealand took the United States Open at Pinehurst No. 2.

But when Phyllis Levenstein first presented her ideas at Columbia University in the 60's, she was well on her way to creating the Parent-Child Home Program, which has been helping prepare children for school for 40 years. ''She was a genius, pure and simple,'' said Sarah Walzer, the executive director of the program's national center in Port Washington. ''Her goal was to help reduce the numbers of high school dropouts by working with 2- and 3-year-olds, and she was decades ahead of brain development research.''

I like to talk during movies, and particularly enjoy it when others do, and I'm getting tired of all the people telling us that we shouldn't. During a recent showing of ''Aeon Flux,'' for example, someone sitting near me said of the black-helmeted Bregnan troops: ''What do they have on their heads? They look like dehumidifiers!'' Far from being shushed, he should have shared that insight with everyone.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Looking Back, and Forward With Hope;None;Job Market;article;News;IT'S become a ''Life's Work'' tradition at this time of year to catch up with people I've written about in the past and ask them about their hopes for the future. This year the choice was easy. The two columns that seemed to catch your attention most in 2005 were about workers in need of help. And you didn't just read their stories -- you reached out and helped them. The first column was about Robert Koagel, a truck driver from Syracuse, whose daughter Kaitelyn had received a heart transplant soon after birth a decade earlier. The years since then had been good ones -- Mr. Koagel's income was enough to support his wife and four children (with a fifth on the way) and to buy a house.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Spinning Our Wheels;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;Op-Ed;LAST month, during the height of holiday festivities in Manhattan, my husband and I attempted to join a group of 12 people at one of the trendiest, most famous Asian restaurants on the Upper East Side to celebrate a close friend's birthday. Because my husband, Tom, is a 45-year-old quadriplegic (nine months after our wedding 12 years ago, he broke his neck diving into our pool) and confined to a 300-pound electric wheelchair, our friend's wife called the restaurant in advance to ensure that it was fully wheelchair-accessible. The restaurant assured her that it was. However, after driving into Manhattan from our home in the suburbs and arriving at the restaurant, we encountered an unwelcome surprise. There was no elevator, ramp or kitchen access, and the restaurant's staff looked at us dumbfounded and confused.

In her new book, ''Washoku,'' Andoh takes us into the Japanese home kitchen, where, in the spirit of washoku cooking, meals are a complex mosaic of color, cooking technique, flavor, texture and appearance. Complementing the recipes are vivid photos of Japanese ingredients and equipment, like kombu (kelp) and pancake-shaped otoshi-buta (pot lids), displayed on trays, plates and linens that make the American table seem so staid. We asked Andoh to develop recipes for the tekka-don and katsu-don so beloved during Heidi Julavits's time in Japan.

I thought the action was supposed to be on the field, not in the stands. Why don't we give the fans strobe lights or even firearms, and be done with it? Matthew Katz Roosevelt Island

She also had her doubts about how wholesome a place the East Side's Seward Park of a decade and a half ago would be for her son, Asa, who is now 16, to play in. But when she moved west she had no idea just how child-oriented TriBeCa was, and would never have predicted what a haven for the small set it would become.

At a conference table not quite large enough for the dozen members who attended, Commissioner Joshua Lipsman gently steered the discussion through a minefield of potential public health decisions, like requiring helmets for soccer players and barring those under age 16 from tanning salons. Dr. Lipsman's office in the same building, which has sweeping views of Long Island Sound, was nothing if not a contrast. The soft-spoken doctor, a specialist in family and preventive medicine, settled in to answer questions about his current accomplishment: completing law school at Pace University, after three and a half years of night classes.

His argument only strengthens the image of two Americas -- the one, as Bai writes, ''where so many Americans earn stock dividends and where a growing number are self-employed''; and the other, where 1.3 million workers are employed by Wal-Mart, many at a subsistence-level income. This stark choice could define the nature of our democracy in the 21st century: will we elect representatives who care more about our quality of life than about our quantity of stuff?

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Screen First: Scorsese and Jaaack;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;MOVIE fans are so busy picking among the Oscar-ready riches on display for the holidays that they probably haven't noticed that 2006 is shaping up as a banner year for film intrigue, much of it on the set. Most deliciously, Martin Scorsese and Jack Nicholson, two of the not-so-enfants terribles of American cinema, have been working together for the first time. ''The Departed'' is a cop/Mafia drama set in Boston, with a potboiler of a plot and buckets of blood. Both Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Nicholson came of age along with independent film in this country, and even though neither has exactly captivated audiences lately, the combination of their heavyweight résumés and respective histories of getting their own way should lead to combustion on screen and off in a movie that will create months of chatter in 2006.

''The idea that cable could add something that you could get free, there was a lot of skepticism about that,'' said Charles Dolan, the chairman of the Cablevision Systems Corporation.

The concerns appear to have played a part in the temporary suspension of the secret program. The concerns prompted two of President Bush's most senior aides -- Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff, and Alberto R. Gonzales, then White House counsel and now attorney general -- to make an emergency visit to a Washington hospital in March 2004 to discuss the program's future and try to win the needed approval from Attorney General John Ashcroft, who was hospitalized for gallbladder surgery, the officials said.

But the ''Anti-Rape Condom,'' or Rapex, is impractical. The likelihood that any woman would be able to use such a thing in time to protect herself from rape is so slim as to be ridiculous.

Spooked by high energy costs and cooling home prices, investors pushed down the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday, causing that gauge to end the year about six-tenths a percentage point lower than where it started. Sales of previously owned homes fell 1.7 percent in November, to an annual rate of 6.97 million. That is the slowest pace since March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices continued to rise, but economists say that is unlikely to continue as the slower rate of sales increases the number of homes on the market.

John Robert Murren, M.D., 47, renowned medical oncologist, researcher, associate professor of medicine at Yale University and founder of Nevada Cancer Institute succumbed to a noble battle with melanoma on December 28, 2005 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, while surrounded by his family. His life was dedicated to discovery, healing and the advancement of humanity. He was the essence of a gentle-man. Dr. Murren was a third generation resident of Fairfield. He was a graduate of Roger Ludlowe High School, with Honors. Dr. Murren was renowned as a medical oncologist and cancer researcher specializing in the treatment and prevention of lung cancer. Since 1992, he had been awarded grant funding to study cancer drug therapies yielding invaluable contributions to the understanding of the effectiveness of cancer drug therapies, particularly chemotherapy. He was the chief of the Yale Medical Oncology Outpatient Clinic and director of the Lung Cancer Unit at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, CT. He earned his B.A. in Chemistry and History from Duke University cum laude followed by his M.D. in 1984 from the Loyola - Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago. He completed his internship and residency in Internal Medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York where he was chief resident. In 1988, Dr. Murren accepted a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Oncology at the Yale-New Haven Hospital where he was an attending physician as well as an associate professor of Medicine. For the Nevada Cancer Institute, Dr. Murren was one of its early visionaries and founders. The articulation of his vision to bring research-based medicine to Nevada resulted in the founding of the institute in 2002, and the creation of a 142,000 square foot facility in Las Vegas that is dedicated to researching, preventing, detecting, caring and curing cancer. He served on the institute's Board of Directors as well as an adjunct faculty member. At Yale, Dr. Murren had the largest clinical practice at the Cancer Center and treated thousands of patients and their families over a distinguished career. As a researcher, he was exceptionally gifted and his clinical research widely published. He sat on several peer review Boards and was sought out worldwide for his expertise. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Frisbee Foundation. In addition to his clinical, educational and research endeavors, Dr. Murren served on the Clinical Research Subcommittee of the American Association of Cancer Research and the American College of Surgeons Cancer Committee. He also served as co-chair of Novel Therapeutics for the American Association of Cancer Research National Meeting in 2001. He was a member of the Research Grants Council in Hong Kong and was an active lecturer and writer. Dr. Murren is survived by Nancy, his wife; John, his son; Jean Perkins Murren, his mother; Jim and Michael, his brothers and Kathie, his sister as well as sisters-in-law: Heather Hay Murren and Mary Kay Murren and brothers - in - law George Koether as well as Jeff and Bill Hughes and wives, family and mother-inlaw, Doris Hughes, as well as several nieces and nephews as well as Chessie, his dog, that he truly loved and was loved in return. He was predeceased by his father, Connecticut State Representative and Atty. John Henry Murren, who passed away on February 3, 1990 from melanoma at age 59. His grandfather, John P. Murren, D.D.S. was also a prominent dentist practicing in Fairfield. Dr. Murren led an active life in the Fairfield community. He was a parishioner of St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church. He enjoyed reading, skiing, tennis and especially watching his son, John, play ice hockey. A viewing will be held from 3 pm to 8pm on Tuesday, January 3, 2006 at Shaughnessey Funeral Home, 50 Reef Road, Fairfield, CT (06824). A Memorial Service will be held at 10am on Wednesday, January 4, 2006 at St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church, 1719 Post Rd, Fairfield, CT (06824), with a reception following.

One is an exhibition of paintings at the NEW YORK TRANSIT MUSEUM. After the transit strike, it might be a good way to remind yourself of the redeeming qualities of the subway, including some qualities you'd never considered. The show features 30 pastel and charcoal drawings, oil paintings and linoleum block prints by LAURA CANTOR, who has worked for New York City Transit for 23 years as a subway car inspector. Her work shows exactly what she sees on the job, unadorned but transformed with color. In one pastel, she renders the magnetic latch on an R62 subway car, the kind of car still in use on the Lexington and other lines. The work makes you wonder what would have happened if Thomas Hart Benton had spent some time under a subway train. Corner of Boerum Place and Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn Heights, (718) 694-1600, through April 9. A completely different kind of unusual can be found at the SEAN KELLY GALLERY. MARINA ABRAMOVIC, the radical performance artist who recently spent seven grueling nights onstage in the rotunda of the Guggenheim, often doing violence to herself, has created an elaborate video work that examines ancient connections between sexuality and folklore. Titled ''BALKAN EROTIC EPIC,'' the videos are framed by Ms. Abramovic, in a professorial role, explaining some of the more unexpected ways in which sexuality and the body were employed in Balkan pagan traditions and in other ancient cultures. (If it rained too much in a village, for example, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain.) In adjoining videos, performers hired by the artist enact such rituals, sometimes faithfully and sometimes in ways that reimagine the folklore. 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Ready for Everything Under the Solar Panel;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;UNTIL recently, the alternative energy industry was decidedly alternative. It conjured up images of off-the-grid bohemians heating their cabins with wood-burning stoves, and eccentric tinkerers tricking out cars to run on vegetable oil. But in 2005, alternative, or renewable, energy vaulted the highly fortified border separating cottage industry and big business. With oil and gas prices soaring, the allure of alternate energy sources is apparent.

Bush proclaimed that ''the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.'' Behind these lofty words lies one of the most powerful ideas in international relations. Neoconservative pundits like William Kristol and Lawrence F. Kaplan put the point plainly when they called for toppling Saddam Hussein because of ''a truth of international politics: democracies rarely, if ever, wage war against one another.''
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Pipe Down! We Can Hardly Hear You;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;WHEN ''Doctor Atomic,'' the much-anticipated opera about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project by the dynamic American composer John Adams, had its premiere in October at the San Francisco Opera, the critical reaction was all over the place. But whatever one's take on the opera -- I found it, over all, a courageous and musically haunting work -- surprisingly little was made of one of the production's most unorthodox attributes: the sizeable orchestra had 30 microphones positioned among the players, and the singers wore body microphones. Not that long ago, the use of microphones in a major opera house would have provoked critics and buffs to denounce the perpetrators with blood-chilling Verdian curses of ''Muori! Muori!'' A love of natural sound, the unaided human voice and traditional instruments have, after all, been hallmarks of classical music and opera. But electronic amplification has been insinuating itself into the opera house and the concert hall, much as it did on Broadway starting in the early 1960's. To the dismay of traditionalists, the public, by and large, doesn't seem to mind.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Making of an Ice Princess;Roberta Butler letter notes synchronized skating, team event, is fastest-growing segment of US Figure Skating program (Dec 18 article);Magazine;article;Letter;As the mother of a 17-year-old figure skater, I read with interest about Emily Hughes. How familiar it all is: the coach, the custom boots, the focus, the expense. But a small point in Green's well-written article gave me pause. He says, ''Synchronized skating, a relatively new team sport popular at colleges, seems inane because it relaxes that central tension'' -- the drama of self-sufficiency. I realize that Green is referring to the notion of one person alone on the ice before a judgmental world. But the analogy to synchronized skating seems comparable to saying that playing an instrument in an orchestra is silly and that musicians should play only solo performances. Freestyle skating is a solo event; synchronized skating is a team event. It is, in fact, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. Figure Skating program.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Nuclear Problem And Our Pal Beijing;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;CONSUMED by its response to 9/11, the Bush administration rarely focused on China in its first term. Now ''later'' has arrived. The biggest test of Washington-Beijing realpolitik in 2006 may be North Korea and Iran. For the first time, the White House finds itself deeply dependent on the active help of China's leaders. If it has any hope of stopping the nuclear programs in Pyongyang and Tehran, it needs Beijing's leverage. Unfortunately for Mr. Bush, the interests of China and the United States are quite different.

By Nicholas Sparks. (Warner Books, $24.95.) Sparks's latest romance revisits two characters he introduced in an earlier novel, ''True Believer.'' Jeremy, a divorced magazine writer from New York, fell in love with Lexie, a young librarian, while doing research in her hometown in North Carolina. Now he has decided to move down South to marry her -- despite the fact that, as a friend points out, he's ''only spent a week with her.'' Sure enough, Jeremy soon discovers that while the air in Boone Creek may be ''scented with perfume and pine and salted mist,'' there's very little for a transplanted city boy to do -- except fall into a fugue state of paranoid jealousy. Sparks's prose has the amiable, folksy rhythm of a rocking chair on a wraparound porch, but beware: his dialogue can be knuckle-bitingly bad (''Now, dat dere's a purty ring,'' one yokel tells Lexie). He also has an incurable weakness for corny characters (like the meddlesome Mayor Gherkin) and Hallmark-card aphorisms (''Life has a tendency to throw curveballs when you least expect them''). Yet even though his book is hokey to the core, Sparks gives it an ending that manages to surprise.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Style; Kandy Land;Style column;Magazine;article;News;It is an eccentricity of fashion that just as winter begins to nip at your sling-back heels, and cashmere starts to seem less like a luxury and more like a basic human need, scanty bathing suits, filmy sundresses and the strappiest of sandals suddenly appear in the stores like an act of demented defiance. But fashion knows, often before we do, exactly when we long to be somewhere else, and the sartorial manifestation of this longing is an annual collection known as resort. At Helga's Folly in Sri Lanka, overlooking the ancient city of Kandy, resort clothes make sense both in reality and as concept. Not just because at this time of year the weather is generally fine. But rather because the seat of the de Silva family, a 1930's Art Deco chalet that Helga de Silva Blow Perera not so long ago transformed into a colorful 40-room guest house, is in its own way an act of demented defiance. Monkeys swing on the balconies, fairies guard the pool and at lunchtime the sandwiches are served the old-fashioned way with the crusts removed. The de Silva heritage, which extends to art, antiques, politics (George and Agnes de Silva helped secure Sri Lankan independence in 1948), architecture (Esme de Silva, a member of the Bauhaus, designed the chalet; Minette de Silva, a girlfriend of Le Corbusier, was among Asia's first female architects) and general intrigue, stands in for décor. And Helga's notorious daughter-in-law, the fashion instigator and editor Isabella Blow, wearer of virtually unwearable Alexander McQueen frocks and Philip Treacy headdresses, does not hold a candle to our host. But you see where she's coming from. Here, among the pine forests, the waterfalls, the ''Mogambo'' jungles, the tea plantations and the drawing rooms, a feather-print gown, a floppy hat and a pair of shoes conjured from a pair of scarves hardly seem eccentric but entirely appropriate.

Cute I thought. But he also wrote: ''Few cities on Earth have longer winter nights than Oslo. '' But at least 20 cities in Norway have longer nights than Oslo. And all the cities north of the Arctic Circle have something called morketid, when it is dark (or night) the whole day. At Svalbard, a little island outside the coast of Norway, they have four months morketid every year! In Tromso, capital of North-Norway, morketid lasts for 2 1/2 months. And when it's summer we have 2 1/2 months where the sun always shines.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;More Open Space, More Affordable Housing;None;Long Island Weekly Desk;article;News;WHEN three Democrats swept the town board election here last month, they did so on a platform that simultaneously called for preserving more open space and building more affordable housing. That strategy was not a new one but has over the past two decades helped many town candidates, Democrats and Republicans, win support from two significant blocs of voters. Curtailing development through the public acquisition of vacant land appeals to the wealthy owners of second homes and recent refugees from New York City; they want to maintain the high property values and rural characteristics that drew them in the first place. Building more publicly subsidized housing appeals to year-round working-class residents; as the median house price has soared beyond $825,000, they have watched affordable rentals all but disappear.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Spinning Our Wheels;None;The City Weekly Desk;article;Op-Ed;LAST month, during the height of holiday festivities in Manhattan, my husband and I attempted to join a group of 12 people at one of the trendiest, most famous Asian restaurants on the Upper East Side to celebrate a close friend's birthday. Because my husband, Tom, is a 45-year-old quadriplegic (nine months after our wedding 12 years ago, he broke his neck diving into our pool) and confined to a 300-pound electric wheelchair, our friend's wife called the restaurant in advance to ensure that it was fully wheelchair-accessible. The restaurant assured her that it was. However, after driving into Manhattan from our home in the suburbs and arriving at the restaurant, we encountered an unwelcome surprise. There was no elevator, ramp or kitchen access, and the restaurant's staff looked at us dumbfounded and confused.

It's hard to imagine, for example, the characters on ''Desperate Housewives'' attending such an event, unless it was played for viciously comic effect. Yet ''home parties,'' even in the era of dual incomes and online shopping, are still very much with us. The Direct Selling Association, a trade group, claims that the number of people involved in this form of selling more than doubled, to 13.3 million from 6.3 million between 1994 and 2003. AtHome America is one of many companies using a Tupperware-style sales force of women in the homes of their neighbors, and one of its most popular products, Angel of a Friend, helps explain why.

He insists that his real motive in conducting the war in Iraq is to democratize one of the least democratic corners of the earth. He regularly quotes Harry Truman, who rebuilt Japan and Germany while remaking American national security policy from the ground up. Several of his speeches have deliberately included Churchillian echoes about never surrendering to terrorists and achieving total victory, along with made-for-television imagery to drive home the message.

I'm seated, with my mother, on a palace veranda, cooled by a breeze from the royal garden. Before us, on a dais, is an empty throne, its arms and legs embossed with polished brass, the back and seat covered in black-and-gold silk. In front of the steps to the dais, there are two columns of people, mostly men, facing one another, seated on carved wooden stools, the cloths they wear wrapped around their chests, leaving their shoulders bare. There is a quiet buzz of conversation. Outside in the garden, peacocks screech. At last, the blowing of a ram's horn announces the arrival of the king of Asante, its tones sounding his honorific, kotokohene, ''porcupine chief.'' (Each quill of the porcupine, according to custom, signifies a warrior ready to kill and to die for the kingdom.) Everyone stands until the king has settled on the throne. Then, when we sit, a chorus sings songs in praise of him, which are interspersed with the playing of a flute. It is a Wednesday festival day in Kumasi, the town in Ghana where I grew up.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Calling From Abroad at Reasonable Rates;None;Travel Desk;article;News;WHILE internationally capable cell phones make calling home from abroad convenient, they're not always the most economical choice. For travelers looking for inexpensive alternatives, there are several options: new Internet-based voice services, callback services and one of the most low-tech -- and low-cost-- options: prepaid calling cards. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES The big news in calling home cheaply is ''voice over Internet protocol'' (VoIP) services like Vonage (www.vonage.com), which is based in Holmdel, N.J., or Skype (www.skype.com), a company based in Luxembourg that was recently purchased by eBay. Since VoIP services generally work best with a broadband or wireless Internet connection, they are recommended for travelers who want to make calls from fixed locations, such as their hotel rooms or a conference room -- although they can also be used from Internet cafes, or wireless hot spots if you have a notebook computer. (Some specialized VoIP services or phones like Vonage's Wi-Fi Utstarcom F1000 phone will only work at 'open' hot spots that do not require a user name or credit card.)

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Plan for Heating Aid Runs Into a Cold Front From Alaska;None;Connecticut Weekly Desk;article;News;TO help people pay skyrocketing heating bills this winter, Congress was ready to spread $2 billion throughout the country in emergency aid. Connecticut officials expected to get millions of dollars they had been seeking for months. And then the polar bears in Alaska got in the way. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is thousands of miles from Connecticut, but the animals there featured prominently in a series of deals just before Christmas that ended with the heating aid being eliminated. Now, Connecticut officials are concerned that poor families will not get the money they need this winter, at least not from the federal government.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;The Real World: Prestonsburg, Kentucky;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;THE young men of ''The O.C.'' on Fox aside, teenage boys on the threshold of adulthood can be scary, variously sullen and secretive, blustery and outspoken. For many Americans, Appalachia seems frightening too, all stereotype and no subtlety. The independent filmmaker David Sutherland explores both realms in his latest cinéma vérité documentary, ''Country Boys,'' airing over three nights on ''Frontline'' on PBS, starting on Jan. 9. Mr. Sutherland specializes in the back alleys of American life, taking years to find and follow his subjects and then forming a coherent story from the hundreds of hours of their lives caught on tape.

For Mr. Schiff, it represents a return to live theater, which is how he began his career. For Ms. Mileaf, it is a return to the place she landed her first theater job more than 20 years ago. Mr. Schiff, who plays the White House communications director on ''The West Wing,'' described his nameless character in ''Underneath the Lintel'' as ''a guy you see on the bus for six months and you don't notice for six months.'' The man, a Dutch librarian who lives in quiet isolation, has a life-changing experience when he decides to find out who anonymously returned a library book borrowed 113 years earlier.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;TBR: Inside the List;None;Book Review Desk;article;Review;PEACE POEM: This week's best-seller list, the first of the new year, tracks bookstore sales through the week ending Dec. 17: the week before the week before Christmas. There aren't a lot of new books here -- traditionally, publishers don't release many titles in December -- but Maya Angelou's pint-size stocking stuffer of a poem, ''Amazing Peace,'' moves up to No. 4 in its second week. Angelou, who delivered her poem ''On the Pulse of Morning'' at Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, composed ''Amazing Peace'' for the lighting of the 2005 White House Christmas tree. It's an antiwar poem that's most memorable for being completely unmemorable: it's like being Mannheim Steamrolled. (''Into this climate of fear and apprehension, Christmas enters, / Streaming lights of joy, ringing bells of hope.'') It didn't hurt sales that Angelou read her poem on ''Oprah,'' where Winfrey called her ''my spiritual mother,'' or that Angelou has her own Hallmark Christmas special on TV this year. For readers who prefer their eggnog spiked, David Sedaris's ''Holidays on Ice'' is back on the nonfiction paperback list at No. 10; it's become a perennial Christmas best seller. In fact, nearly all of Sedaris's books are selling pretty well, years after they were first published -- ''Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim'' is No. 19 on the extended nonfiction paperback list, and ''Me Talk Pretty One Day'' is No. 25.

When Bert Parks warbled ''There she is '' to wrap up the mid-September pageant, the sound of locks clicking shut for the winter on the doors of theaters and clubs could practically be heard in the background. Even after casinos started opening in the late 1970's and early 1980's, things slowed perceptibly by first frost. The big acts mostly came during summer and for a few weeks before and after. Each casino would have a revue or a lounge act through the winter, but the crowd was mostly looking to gamble and to have a few drinks.

And yet, one brutally cold winter evening in 2003, dozens of people were slipping along the icy sidewalk from the subway to a storefront performance space to see a show called ''What's That on My HEAD!?!'' The draw: an obscure collective called the National Theater of the United States of America, which has stealthily become one of the most exciting and eccentric young theater companies in town. ''They're dreaming big -- and almost no one else is,'' said Jeffrey M. Jones, a playwright and the co-curator of the monthly performance series Little Theater at Tonic.

While it is considerably bigger than his former house, in Chenango Forks, N.Y., it will cost far less to cool and to heat. That is because he did something he had thought about ever since he built his last house, 15 years earlier: he installed a geothermal system instead of an oil-guzzling boiler. Now all the heat to warm his house is supplied by the earth beneath him. It's pumped up, through plastic piping, in water circulating in his backyard six feet underground -- where the temperature stays at about 45 degrees -- and distributed by a fan through the house's ductwork as air warmed to around 95 degrees.

The hypermethodical Singaporean government is working hard to rebrand the city-state's staid image.

Could it really find someone to fill the shoes of Michael Hutchence, the charismatic lead singer who died under the influence of drugs and alcohol in 1997? Did the aging band members still have the creative juices to make new records? And even if the answers to the first two questions were affirmative, would anybody care? Though the show struggled to find an audience at first, it finished strongly. And since then, the band -- with its new lead singer, J. D. Fortune (above) -- has undergone a resurgence, selling out 27 of its 31 North American tour dates, most within two hours of going on sale.

In recent years, two major commissions -- the Congressionally established United States Commission on Ocean Policy and the independent Pew Oceans Commission -- have urged prompt action to end overfishing of commercially valuable species, reduce pollution from cities and farms, restore wetlands and control development along the coasts. Obviously, a problem of this magnitude requires intervention by Washington and even international organizations, but the states -- which control waters up to three miles offshore -- also have important roles to play. With that in mind, some states, notably California, have recently strengthened their laws and overhauled the way they manage ocean resources. Now a coalition of environmental groups is urging Gov. George Pataki to do the same.

Well, no matter how much egg you've nogged or how many corks you've popped, there's no hangover you wouldn't set aside to attend one of the great parties of the last century -- the Beaux-Arts Ball of Jan. 23, 1931. The skyscraper architects who ran it also suffered a stupendous hangover -- but for them it was the Great Depression. Founded in 1894, the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects attracted the well-to-do and cultured of the profession, many of whom had studied at the famous École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. After the turn of the 20th century, they took over an old stable on 75th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, and in 1914 they gave a ball with costumes and décor on the theme ''Venice Through the Ages.''

The issue spurs a reminiscence. Walking down Broadway on a chilly Upper West Side morning in 1972, I bumped into my good acquaintance, the novelist Anthony Burgess, and at his request I resigned to him the bottle of Fundador I had just purchased at a nearby liquor store. Standing in a tattered robe and blinking in the sun, after a night devoted to composition, Burgess required immediate medication. Besides, he had introduced me to this invigorating Spanish brandy only a few weeks before, so I urged him to retain the bottle after he had absorbed two prodigious swigs outdoors. As I wended back to the liquor shop, he called out after me: ''The debt shall be paid, Bloom! When you arrive in Limbo, I will await you there with a bottle of Fundador.''

It is a Marriott property that opened a year ago and has 575 rooms, including suites, a large spa, three pools, four restaurants, a golf course and its own Starbucks. The hotel is spread throughout a sprawling yet tastefully integrated minipueblo in the Sonoran Desert. But the staffers, though friendly and chipper, appear to be a bit overwhelmed. THE LOCATION -- Due west of downtown and about 12 miles from the airport, the hotel is nestled among the low hills and majestic Saguaro cactuses of the Starr Pass development and abuts Saguaro National Park. THE ROOMS -- With just 35 suites, most guests sleep in standard rooms, which are perfectly roomy. Mine was labeled ''luxury view,'' and from the balcony afforded vistas of the surrounding landscape, the city, a spectacular morning sunrise -- and, unfortunately, an eyeful of the trafficked hotel grounds. Inside, the usual beige color scheme was perked up by some creative touches, including a beaten-copper lamp and a brightly glazed pottery plate. Also in the room were a leather club chair and a large glass-topped wooden desk. A dark-wood armoire had two low drawers, a cabinet containing a flat-screen television (with about 40 channels) and a minibar. The new taupe carpet had an obvious stain the size of a fist at the foot of my king-sized bed. The bed, though, was wonderfully firm and topped with feather pillows and a thick down comforter. THE BATHROOMS -- Behind the cool sliding wooden door was a wide, speckled-gray marble-topped sink with a selection of products by Nirvae Botanicals. A hair dryer and a coffeemaker were stored underneath. To the left was a large bathtub, and to the right were the toilet and a shower with a glass door, honey-hued marble walls and massage shower head. THE CROWD -- Vacationers, including both couples and families with kids, had a distinctly well-scrubbed, suburban air. Because of its large meeting halls, conferences frequently pack the place. AMENITIES -- A full-service salon, business center (with computers that cost 49 cents per minute with a $5 minimum), bike rentals, a fitness center, gift shops, a children's recreation program, and hiking/tour guides can keep you busy. The resort's main draws are the golf club, which features a 27-hole course, the Catalina Steakhouse and the 20,000 square-foot Hashani Spa with 23 treatment rooms. The most popular dining option is the Signature Grill (desert-chic style and a low-lighted outdoor patio). A special of blackened sea bass with cactus ($23) was delicious, but service was slow and rough around the edges -- as it was throughout the property on my visit in October. The alfresco Salud cocktail lounge, for example, was a tranquil oasis -- dramatic fire pits, cozy banquettes, high-end tequilas -- until a busload of University of Arizona students, many with open cans of Coors Light, stumbled in and boisterously took over the place for a birthday blowout. ''I don't know what's going on,'' said a baby-faced doorman. ''They just pulled right up.'' Bartenders served the youngsters as hotel guests looked on helplessly. ROOM SERVICE -- An extensive menu is always available. My All-American Breakfast -- $14 for two eggs, potatoes, toast, coffee, juice and a choice of bacon, sausage or jalapeño chicken sausage -- arrived hot and on time at 9 a.m. THE BOTTOM LINE -- Standard rooms start at $229 and suites start at $375. Use the spa and the scenery to keep you mellow, and the service glitches may not bother you at all.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Did Someone Say Good Grief?;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;News;When he died in 2000, the cartoonist Charles M. Schulz was remembered in many obituaries as a man who never forgot a slight. He forever resented the syndicate that forced the title ''Peanuts'' on his strip. So what would he have thought of the variously drunk, gay, homophobic, abusive and pyromaniacal characters who populate the Off Broadway satire ''Dog Sees God''? Oh, sure, they have assumed names like C. B., Van and Beethoven, but audiences know who these troubled teenagers really are. The show is subtitled ''Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead,'' after all, and there's no doubting the origin of that epithet. The creative team behind the show, wary of upsetting the Schulz estate, had to tread a fine legal line.

Sticking out of his bulging black nylon bag on rollers -- was he thinking of moving in? -- were several rolls of yellow tracing paper, one of which he would unfurl and place over a floor plan of the eight-room West Side apartment that he had enlarged from an online real estate listing. But first he took a lightning-fast tour, during which he spent most of his time peering out windows, and checking out which walls were structurally vital. He then got down on his hands and knees in the living room and started making bold lines in ink on the tissue paper.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Where Anything Goes, And Usually Goes Together;None;Travel Desk;article;News;SOME cities wear tethers. Think Paris, Rome, Tokyo -- all in countries with culinary heritages so celebrated and identifiable that many of the cities' finest restaurants must bow to that legacy and define themselves in relation to it, even if using it as a point of departure rather than a destination. Other cities are unbound. Think London, New York, Sydney -- all in countries with less storied culinary traditions, and thus more culinary freedom. Many of the most ambitious restaurants in these places are shaped less by the past than by the present, by immigration and the cities' senses of themselves as global crossroads, international playgrounds. Anything goes.

For now, it stops abruptly in a cloud of construction dust at a makeshift checkpoint a few hundred yards from here. But at dusk, its future path is outlined by a necklace of lights. Following routes traveled by Israelis, the lights turn eastward, to trace the contours of barren hills before coiling tightly around the Kochav Yaakov settlement. The surrounding territory, inhabited by Palestinians, is enveloped in darkness.

But just because she is a black feminist, Ms. Brooks refuses to be pigeonholed.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7; DANCE;None;Arts and Leisure Desk;article;Schedule;Dance fans who don't want to brave winter weather can enjoy a fascinating new biography, ''MAY O'DONNELL: MODERN DANCE PIONEER,'' by MARIAN HOROSKO (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, $21). Ms. O'Donnell , who died last year, danced with Martha Graham at various times in the 30's and 40's, attracting attention with her tall, sturdy presence. Her own choreography was equally sturdy. In 1943 she created ''Suspension,'' which some historians consider the first totally abstract modern-dance composition. Ms. O'Donnell was long a resident of the East Village, and Community Board 3 has given its approval to name the block where she lived on East Seventh Street, between Avenues B and C, MAY O'DONNELL WAY. Fans venturing outdoors will also be rewarded. THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET opens its winter repertory season on Tuesday night with three plotless one-act works of the sort for which the company is famous: two masterpieces by GEORGE BALANCHINE -- the elegant ''Concerto Barocco'' and the effervescent ''Symphony in C'' -- and PETER MARTINS's propulsive ''Fearful Symmetries.'' But the company also dances some multi-act dramatic works, and one of them, Mr. Martins's staging of ''Swan Lake,'' returns to the repertory on Friday night. This version emphasizes the story's melancholy. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, www.nycballet.com. SARAH EAST JOHNSON creates her own fantastic realm in ''(w)HOLE,'' her new production for her troupe, LAVA. But its fantasies are based on the wonders of nature: ''(w)HOLE,'' an acronym for Whole History of Life on Earth, depicts the saga of evolution with the aid of dance, trapeze work and acrobatics.

2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Find Mencken at nature-abhors-a-moron.com;None;Week in Review Desk;article;News;THE premier American social critic of the first half of the 20th century was probably Henry Louis Mencken (1880-1956). Certainly he was among the most prolific. In a career of almost 50 years, Mencken wrote more than 70 million words -- many intended to expose hypocrisy, debunk received wisdom and take on all manner of sacred cows. Among his favorite targets were democracy, organized religion, Prohibition, marriage (until he himself wed), modern architecture and chiropractors. Mencken published mainly in The Baltimore Sun, The American Mercury and The Smart Set. But if he had flourished in the age of computer keyboards, would he have dispensed his crusty wisdom on a Web log?
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;A Bit of Doodling About a Tax-Cut Danger;Daniel Altman Economic View column on conclusions reached in Congressional Budget Office analysis by Ben Page of possible effects of 10 percent cut in income tax rates; photo (M);Money and Business/Financial Desk;article;News;EARLY last month, without much fanfare, the Congressional Budget Office released a paper called ''Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates.'' At a modest seven pages, it didn't elicit the same sort of interest as the budget office's budgetary and economic outlooks. Yet it may be one of the most important government publications in years. As Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the budget office's director, writes in a brief summary at the beginning of the paper, most predictions of the effects of tax-rate changes ''do not include the budgetary impact of any possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies.'' In other words, the predictions don't take into account how tax cuts could affect the overall size of the economy. It is this omission -- one often cited by proponents of tax cuts, especially in the White House -- that the paper tries to correct.
2006-01-01T00:00:00Z;Cheap Rooms, and 'a Drug for Every Floor';None;Metropolitan Desk;article;News;The Greenpoint Hotel is still listed in a few tourist guides, which promise cheap rooms and warn of the brusque if efficient staff. But few map-carrying bargain-hunters stay there these days. The hallways stink of marijuana and urine; the bathrooms -- one per floor -- are caked in dirt, and hot water is rare. The front desk is barricaded shut with sheets of plywood. Theft and violence are a constant threat. ''My room is a box -- it's the size of a prison cell,'' one resident, Jaime Rodriguez, said as he stood outside a deli near the hotel recently, swaying slightly, his eyes cloudy. Mr. Rodriguez said he had lived at the Greenpoint for a decade, paying rent with disability checks. ''This whole place is a prison,'' he said.

Some stranded people had to be evacuated by helicopter. Scattered power failures were reported.

Mr. Miller's detour from a more conventional classical path to the pop superhighway, where he now sings operatic renditions of ''My Way'' and ''Unbreak My Heart'' in Italian, leaves him shaking his head in wonder.

Tice was 33-34 as a head coach, and he took the Vikings to the playoffs once after taking over on an interim basis at the end of the 2001 season. His firing -- technically, his contract expired and will not be renewed -- was not a surprise. Wilf recently took control of a team mired in on-the-field disappointments and off-the-field embarrassments.

If the seedings hold up, it will be Jake Plummer (18 touchdowns, 7 interceptions) against Cincinnati's Carson Palmer (32 touchdowns, 12 interceptions). 3. Cincinnati Bengals (North champions) 11-5 Pittsburgh They have a home playoff game for the first time in 16 years, against the division-rival Steelers. Cincinnati split with Pittsburgh this season, with the Bengals losing at home early in the season and then beating the Steelers in Pittsburgh with a high-powered offensive attack a month ago. 4. New England Patriots (East champions) 10-6 Jacksonville Despite losing to Miami yesterday, they remain one of the most dangerous teams in the playoffs, winning six of their last eight. No matter who the Jaguars' quarterback is, the Patriots will bring plenty of pressure to make up for a thin and inexperienced secondary. 5. Jacksonville Jaguars 12-4 New England The starting quarterback Byron Leftwich is back after sustaining a broken bone in his ankle on Nov. 27. His backup, David Garrard, went 4-1 as his replacement. Coach Jack Del Rio used Garrard as the starter yesterday as he rested several starters in a pounding of Tennessee. 6. Pittsburgh Steelers 11-5 Cincinnati One of the hottest teams entering the playoffs, with a four-game winning streak. They beat Cincinnati early in the season on the road, but the Bengals were the last team the Steelers lost to in the regular season. NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE 1 Seattle Seahawks (West champions) 13-3 BYE If the seedings hold up, the Seahawks will play host to the Giants in the divisional round. It would be a rematch of one of the most closely fought games of the regular season, in which Giants place-kicker Jay Feely missed three field-goal attempts that would have beaten the Seahawks in Seattle. 2. Chicago Bears (North champions) 11-5 BYE The best defense in the N.F.L. gets to rest a week. After losing to Minnesota yesterday in a meaningless game, the Bears finished the regular season 10-2 against National Football Conference opponents, tied for best in the conference with Seattle. 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (South champions) 11-5 Washington They finished a worst-to-first turnaround by beating the Saints yesterday to clinch the division and a home game. They beat the Redskins on Nov. 13, when Coach Jon Gruden went for a 2-point conversion instead of kicking an extra point for a tie with 58 seconds left. 4.. Giants (East champions) 11-5 Carolina Securing a home playoff game was significant because quarterback Eli Manning has won away from Giants Stadium just three times. Much of the burden will fall on the secondary, which must contain receiver Steve Smith, who finished the season with 1,432 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. 5. Carolina Panthers 11-5 Giants They trounced Atlanta yesterday to get in, and now the former Giants defensive coordinator John Fox will play his old team with an offense that averaged 30 points a game over the last three games of the regular season. 6. Washington Redskins 10-6 Tampa Bay They looked lethargic in beating the Eagles yesterday to clinch a berth, but have won five in a row. They lost to Tampa Bay in a nailbiter in November.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Satire That Spares Nothing, Not Even God and Country;None;Foreign Desk;article;News;To the thumping beat of ''Stayin' Alive,'' a super-size version of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appears sporty in a blue jogging suit and sweatband, with no aftereffects from his recent stroke. He raises his arms in Rocky-style triumph and jogs into the studio of Israel's hit spoof news show, ''A Wonderful Country.'' The character playing his rival, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, appears taken aback by Mr. Sharon's recovery and mutters under his breath, ''I'm going to sue the Western Wall,'' referring to a note to God, apparently not containing good wishes, that he had tucked into the holiest site in Judaism.
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Spending Pocket Change Over the Internet;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;The number of Americans making online purchases of $2 or less is skyrocketing, according to a recent survey. The study found that nearly twice as many people as last year had made such purchases within a year of being surveyed. The survey was commissioned by Peppercoin, a maker of software that enables small online transactions, and carried out by Ipsos, a marketing research firm. Much of the trade behind this increase is in bits and bytes, rather than tangible goods. Digital music, for example, has been a major factor since Apple's iTunes music store started selling music files for 99 cents apiece.

Mr. Jones, 65, a vibrant performer known as much for his swiveling hips onstage as for songs including ''What's New Pussycat'' and ''She's a Lady,'' was honored for services to music. New Yorkers will have a chance to see the newly knighted Sir Tom perform when he plays for two nights at the Nokia Theater in Times Square beginning on Valentine's Day. Also knighted were the jazz musician John Dankworth and the playwright Arnold Wesker. Jonathan Ive, the designer of the iPod and iMac, was named a Companion of the Order of the British Empire. City Ballet Creates a New Post for the New Year The New York City Ballet has announced the appointment of its first composer in residence, Bright Sheng, who begins the job today. Mr. Sheng, right, came from China in 1982, and studied composition and conducting with Leonard Bernstein. In 2003, he was named the Leonard Bernstein Distinguished University Professor of Music at the University of Michigan, where he has taught since 1995. He will conduct the ballet's orchestra, take part in educational events and serve a variety of other functions. He will also compose two pieces of music that will be used for world premiere ballets during the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The residency is part of the ballet's Artist in Residence program, which began in 2000 with the intention of bringing artists of various disciplines to the company for extended periods of time. Rapper Shot On Detroit Freeway The rapper Obie Trice, a protégé of Eminem, was shot early Saturday morning on a Detroit freeway, The Associated Press reported. While driving on the Lodge Freeway just after 1 a.m. on Saturday, Mr. Trice, 28, right, was hit by a bullet that came through the rear window of his car. Mr. Trice, a native of Detroit, was able to get off the freeway and stop the car, allowing his girlfriend to flag down the police. He was taken to Providence Hospital, where he was treated and released. There were no suspects in the shooting, which was still under investigation by the state police. Eminem produced Mr. Trice's debut album, ''Cheers,'' in 2003. Jeff Daniels Play Comes to New York Though primarily known as a stage and screen actor, most recently appearing in ''The Squid and the Whale,'' Jeff Daniels, below, is also a musician and playwright. In 1991, he formed the Purple Rose Theater in a bus garage in Chelsea, Mich., and has written nine plays for the company. ''Apartment 3A,'' originally produced at the Purple Rose in 1996, will have its New York premiere this month in a production at the Arclight Theater, with Valentina Fratti directing. ''Apartment 3A'' is a romantic comedy with a spiritual twist -- a modern ghost story. ''Given all the recent public debate about the importance of religion in our lives,'' Mr. Daniels said, ''I think the play probably has more relevance now than it did when we premiered it.'' Information on the New York production is available at apartment3a.com. Bono Talks Of Tension in U2 In a weekend interview with BBC radio, U2's front man, Bono, said his work campaigning against poverty had created tension in the band, at one point causing him to think he might be forced out of the group, The Associated Press reported. Bono, a leader of this year's Make Poverty History campaign and the Live 8 concert, frequently makes statements about global poverty from the stage during U2 concerts, and acknowledged that he had sometimes ''raised eyebrows'' among his fellow band members. Still, other band members ''are hugely supportive spiritually and financially,'' he said. ''But they are in a rock 'n' roll band, and the first job of a rock 'n' roll band is not to be dull.''

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Nearer, My God, to the G.O.P.;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;NANCY PELOSI, the Democratic leader in the House, sounded like an Old Testament prophet recently when she denounced the Republican budget for its ''injustice and immorality'' and urged her colleagues to cast their no votes ''as an act of worship'' during this religious season. This, apparently, is what the Democrats had in mind when they vowed after President Bush's re-election to reclaim religious voters for their party. In the House, they set up a Democratic Faith Working Group. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, created a Web site called Word to the Faithful. And Democratic officials began holding conferences with religious progressives. All of this was with the intention of learning how to link faith with public policy. An event for liberal politicians and advocates at the University of California at Berkeley in July even offered a seminar titled ''I Don't Believe in God, but I Know America Needs a Spiritual Left.''
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Metro Briefing | New York: Queens: Officer Struck During Traffic Stop;None;Metropolitan Desk;article;News;A city police officer was hit by a car early yesterday during a traffic stop on the Grand Central Parkway, near the Long Island Expressway in Corona, the police said. The officer had gotten out of his cruiser to arrest a driver he suspected of being drunk, whom he pulled over at 1:20 a.m., when another driver sideswiped the cruiser and hit the officer, said Detective John Sweeney, a police spokesman. The officer was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center in stable condition with a broken leg. The woman who was driving the car that hit him was taken unconscious to Elmhurst Hospital Center, Detective Sweeney said. The severity of her injuries prevented police from questioning her, he said. Neither the officer nor the woman was immediately identified.

In the 1750's, that same music also filled the air. Or so it would appear from Lasse Hallstrom's new romantic comedy, ''Casanova,'' in which the infamous rake goes about his mischief accompanied by Vivaldi, Albinoni, Corelli and the like. Indeed, it might even be said that, along with Venice itself, Baroque music plays the libertine's accomplice here. And since ''Casanova'' is a period farce, it also seems logical for the score to embrace the humor and rhythms of opera buffa, as the 18th-century Italian comic opera was known.

They worried aloud about the United States trade deficit, technological overload and corporate intrusions on consumer privacy. Of particular concern were soda machines that allegedly emit subliminal sales pitches. Luckily for them, Mr. Schnauss was there to soothe such twitchy paranoia. His glistening compositions take optimistic beauty to absurd heights. He offers nostalgia for the early 90's, when shoe-gazing British rock bands like My Bloody Valentine drowned sorrows in guitar wash while distorted melodic vocals swirled in eddies of feedback. With his beat-laden approximations of this music, Mr. Schnauss picks up on the escapist possibilities of orchestral noise.

''That is not to say it is going to be worse. It is just going to be different.''
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Sunni Rights and Wrongs in Iraq;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Last month the big challenge was to encourage Sunni Arabs to vote in Iraq's parliamentary election. They did, in hearteningly high numbers. Now the challenge is to convince the Sunnis that the results, giving them only a modest minority of seats, reflect not systematic fraud, but the fact that Sunni Arabs make up only a modest minority -- roughly 20 percent -- of Iraq's population. Convincing them has been no easy task, despite declarations by United Nations and other neutral observers that the elections were fair, credible and transparent. This page has emphasized the need for Iraq's majority Shiites and their Kurdish allies to be more inclusive in dealing with the Sunni Arab minority. But the other side of that coin is that the Sunnis themselves need to accept that in democracies, majorities rule, and that the special privileges they enjoyed under a succession of Sunni-dominated regimes are not a birthright.

Napa County, in wine country, was hit hardest by a drenching storm that forced hundreds of residents from their homes and closed scores of roads, including stretches of Interstate 80, the link between San Francisco and the Sierra Nevada, and parts of U.S. 101 running north of San Francisco. Sections of the two roads were inundated with high water and debris and could be flooded for days, state authorities said.

Each family updated the house, but in modest ways until Tom and Julie Hirschfeld came along. The Hirschfelds purchased the two-story house with its gabled roof and stucco-and-wood-beam exterior for $890,000 in the fall of 2002. Good schools, safe streets, a picturesque community, like-minded neighbors, a relatively short commute to New York -- all these drew the family, just as they drew the previous owners.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;LOOKING AHEAD;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;Schedule;WHITHER THE MARKETS? -- Markets open tomorrow after lackluster late-December trading that was notable mostly for the bond market's inverted yield curve, in which the yields of 2-year Treasury notes moved higher than those on 10-year notes. Economists say they believe the aberration may -- or may not -- presage an economic slowdown. Here are some predictions for the weeks ahead: The dollar, bolstered by the prospect of another interest-rate hike, will gain a bit against the yen and the euro; the price of oil will stay above $60 as OPEC keeps a lid on supplies; gold, which shot up 18.3 percent last year, to $518.90 for February delivery, will continue its ascent; housing prices will cool; stocks will keep dillydallying; and that pesky inverted yield curve will go away. ABOUT THOSE RATE INCREASES -- Let us not forget that a few lonely prognosticators think that the Federal Reserve, under the stewardship of Alan Greenspan's successor, Ben S. Bernanke, above, will surprise everybody (except them) by holding interest rates steady at the Fed's next meeting. With that in mind, soothsayers of all stripes will be studying the minutes of the central bank's Dec. 13 policy-setting meeting, which will be made public tomorrow. THE BIGGEST SHOW ON EARTH -- The International Consumer Electronics Show opens Thursday in Las Vegas, and Bill Gates of Microsoft will start off the five-day event the night before with a speech on what he thinks lies ahead for consumer electronics. The show, the world's biggest technology trade exhibit, will occupy space equivalent to 28 football fields, according to The Associated Press. Participants will range from industry giants like Intel, which will unveil a new generation of multimedia platforms and chips, to mom-and-pop companies eager to display their wares. One event that is being trumpeted on the Web site of the Consumer Electronics Association, the extravaganza's sponsor, is not to be missed. In a ''Fatal1ty Ultimate Gaming Shootout,'' Johnathan Wendel, the five-time world champion PC gamer known as Fatal1ty, will test the gaming skills of participants. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS -- Economists expect the payroll report on Friday to show that 200,000 jobs were created last month, adding to the 3.5 million new hires of the last 17 months. They also think the unemployment rate will either remain at 5 percent or slip to 4.9 percent. Construction spending figures for November (expected to rise 0.6 percent) and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index (expected to fall to 57.1, from 58.1), will be released tomorrow. Factory orders for November (expected to rise 0.8 percent) and store sales for the last week of December will come out on Wednesday.

When measuring the results of Nielsen's estimates for the calendar year, reality shows like Fox's ''Idol'' have an advantage over most scripted programs, because they run for half of a season and do not broadcast repeats that bring down their average ratings. Which is not to sell short the ratings accomplishments of ''Idol'': among 18-to-49-year-olds in 2005, its two weekly installments outdrew everything else on television by approximately 5 million viewers. In the total viewer category, CBS's ''CSI'' (21.98 million) ranked No. 3, behind ''Idol.'' Following ''CSI'' was CBS's spring edition of ''Survivor'' (20.91 million), and then the recently completed fall edition, which brought in 18.3 million. The women of Wisteria Lane on ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' (17.81 million) ascended to No. 6. In the year's Top 10, Fox had the two ''Idols,'' CBS had five shows -- ''Without a Trace'' and ''CSI: Miami'' were Nos. 9 and 10 -- and ABC had three, as the summer edition of ''Dancing With the Stars'' and the last season of ''Monday Night Football'' finished seventh and eighth, respectively.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Skeleton Coach Was Admonished in 2002;US natio;Sports Desk;article;News;Sexual harassment complaints against Tim Nardiello, the coach of the national skeleton team, were raised with the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation shortly after he was hired in 2002, but the federation did not respond with a formal inquiry. Now Nardiello is suspended and being investigated for more recent accusations by several women on the team. According to several athletes and other coaches, Nardiello made inappropriate sexual comments to male and female athletes early in his tenure, and they were reported to the federation. The complaints were lodged with Matt Roy, then the federation's executive director, who said yesterday that he did not remember how extensively the complaints were investigated.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;How to Avoid Another Transit Strike;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;NEW YORK CITY'S transit workers are back on the job, having cut a deal with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that gives the union what it wanted on raises and pensions and gives the authority what it wanted on health care. The city, meanwhile, lost an estimated $1 billion during a frigid holiday shopping week that saw seven million commuters stranded. There's a better way than this to get a contract, and we can institute it simply by building on existing New York state law.

Seen in gripping productions of troubled, troubling plays that span the last century, they fall into two categories, equally warped sides of the same coin: the hardened idealist, who never doubts himself for a second, and the soft skeptic, who doubts absolutely everything but desperately wants to believe. Look into the eyes of one, you may well be hypnotized; catch the gaze of the other, you feel you're drowning. Under normal circumstances, they are not men to risk spending an evening with. But as figures in dramas by iconoclasts dead and living -- from Ibsen and John Osborne to Mike Leigh and Howard Brenton -- they are enlightening and energizing company, bringing new insights to current questions of faith and fanaticism. They are also allowing a varied gallery of actors, from screen stars (Woody Harrelson, Joseph Fiennes) to rising British stage stars (Ben Daniels, Adam Godley), to prove their mettle in style.

Proof for many of those people came earlier this month, when MySpace users began to notice that any references to YouTube, a video-sharing site and a competitor, were erased or blocked from appearing on My-Space. Some MySpace users also reported that when they tried to download videos from YouTube, a patch of white space appeared instead.

The play, a Faustian story about a World War I soldier who sells his soul to the devil, will incorporate new Arabic and English translations, which will be used in the performance, as well as additional music by the Iraqi composer Ahmed Mukhtar. Co-produced by the London based Motion Group and the National Theater of Iraq, the updated revival will feature an expanded narrative that interweaves the original plot with events from the war in Iraq. The Culture Project (www.45bleecker.com) will be host to the play's United States premiere in New York next month. JASON RHYNE
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;M.T.A. Offers Strong Defense Of Union Deal;None;Metropolitan Desk;article;News;The Metropolitan Transportation Authority laid out a detailed defense yesterday of the settlement it signed last week, arguing that an important concession made by the transit workers' union -- having all workers contribute to their health insurance premiums -- is worth more than pension demands the authority abandoned. In an unusual interview with several reporters at noon on New Year's Day, the authority also announced that it would urge the state to revoke the union's ability to collect dues automatically, through payroll deduction. The loss of the ''dues check-off'' -- which comes on top of the $3 million in fines the union faces for contempt of court and the fines faced by most workers for engaging in the illegal three-day strike last month -- could cripple the union.

The Gators have been up and down this season, but were impressive in their regular-season finale, a 34-7 victory over Florida State. The Hawkeyes have one of the top linebacker tandems in the nation in Chad Greenway and Abdul Hodge. Iowa quarterback Drew Tate threw 19 touchdown passes and only 6 interceptions. Alabama (9-2) vs. Texas Tech (9-2) Cotton Bowl, Dallas, 11 a.m., Fox Alabama's defense, ranked second in the nation, meets Texas Tech's second-ranked offense. Alabama started the season with nine straight victories, but lost its last two regular-season games, by 16-13 to Louisiana State and 28-18 at Auburn. Texas Tech passes frequently, and quarterback Cody Hodges led the nation in total offense. Linebacker DeMeco Ryans leads Alabama's defense, which lost cornerback Simeon Castille because of academic ineligibility. Virginia Tech (10-2) vs. Louisville (9-2) Gator Bowl, Jacksonville, Fla., 12:30 p.m., NBC Virginia Tech was heavily favored against Florida State in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game, but the Seminoles pulled off a 27-22 upset to earn a trip to the Orange Bowl and leave the Hokies out of the Bowl Championship Series picture. Louisville is without quarterback Brian Brohm, who had surgery Dec. 5 to repair a torn ligament in his right knee. The Cardinals will rely on running back Michael Bush, who led the nation with 23 rushing touchdowns, and defensive lineman Elvis Dumervil, who led the nation with 20 sacks and set an N.C.A.A. single-season record with 10 forced fumbles. Auburn (9-2) vs. Wisconsin (9-3) Capital One Bowl, Orlando, Fla., 1 p.m., ABC Barry Alvarez will coach his 11th bowl game in the final game of his 16-year tenure at Wisconsin.

Tigers running back Kenny Irons rushed for at least 100 yards in each of his last six games. Notre Dame (9-2) vs. Ohio State (9-2) Fiesta Bowl, Tempe, Ariz., 4:30 p.m., ABC In his first season as Notre Dame's coach, Charlie Weis will try to lead the Irish to their first postseason victory in 12 years. Notre Dame is averaging 489 yards on offense, thanks to the strong play of quarterback Brady Quinn, who was fourth in the nation in passing efficiency and threw 32 touchdown passes. Ohio State has the nation's fourth-ranked defense, led by two of the best linebackers in the nation, A. J. Hawk and Bobby Carpenter. Georgia (10-2) vs. West Virginia (10-1) Sugar Bowl, Atlanta, 8:30 p.m., ABC The Sugar Bowl, moved to Atlanta from New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina, gives Georgia a bowl game in its home state. The Bulldogs won the Southeastern Conference title and West Virginia won the Big East. Georgia quarterback D. J. Shockley threw for 21 touchdowns and rushed for 4. Bulldogs tight end Leonard Pope was the team's leading receiver. Pat White, West Virginia's freshman quarterback, rushed for seven touchdowns this season. FRED BIERMAN

A1 Russia Reduces Ukrainian Gas Russia cut off the flow of natural gas for Ukraine as talks over pricing and transit terms unraveled into a bald political conflict that carried consequences for Ukraine's recovering economy and possibly for gas supplies to Western Europe. The dispute comes a year after the Orange Revolution brought a pro-Western government to power in Ukraine. A7 Taiwan Leader Seeks Arms President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan called for increased arms purchases and warned against greater economic ties to China, in a televised speech that silenced months of speculation that he might soon seek to improve relations across the Taiwan Strait. The speech was Mr. Chen's first policy address since his Democratic Progressive Party fared badly in islandwide municipal elections on Dec. 3. A3 Afghans Ban Barriers on Streets Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, and the Ministry of Interior, apparently responding to both pressure from the new Parliament and longstanding public grumbling, ordered all organizations, foreign and otherwise, to remove barriers obstructing Kabul's streets. A6 Croat Arrest Becomes Example The recent arrest of Ante Gotovina, one of the chief war crimes suspects from the former Yugoslavia, offers lessons that could directly aid efforts to capture the region's other most-wanted fugitives: Radovan Karadzic, the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and his military commander, Gen.

A1 Bush Defends Spy Program President Bush continued to defend both the legality and the necessity of the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program, and he denied that he misled the public last year when he insisted that any government wiretap required a court order.

Defends Settlement The Metropolitan Transportation Authority defended a settlement it signed last week, arguing that the transit union's concession to collect a contribution toward the cost of members' health insurance is worth more than the authority's original pension demands. It will also urge the state to revoke the union's ability to collect dues through automatic payroll deduction.

But as it approached time for Mr. Clark to make his appearance at 11:35 on his annual ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show, more than a year after a stroke forced him to miss last year's broadcast, another question waited to be answered: would Dick Clark be Dick Clark, the symbol of youthfulness and constancy on television for nearly a half-century?
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Take That, Mr. Newsman!; Answering Back To the News Media, Using the Internet;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel, or so goes the old saw. For decades, the famous and the infamous alike largely followed this advice. Even when subjects of news stories felt they had been misunderstood or badly treated, they were unlikely to take on reporters or publishers, believing that the power of the press gave the press the final word. The Internet, and especially the amplifying power of blogs, is changing that. Unhappy subjects discovered a decade ago that they could use their Web sites to correct the record or deconstruct articles to expose what they perceived as a journalist's bias or wrongheaded narration.

For a moment, that seemed to be exactly what would happen. The big Suburban, blocking the view of a Cadillac at the head of the pack, suddenly swerved out of its lane to reveal the lead car stopped in the middle of the track. But before the second Cadillac slammed into the rear of the stopped car, the driver was alerted to the danger by a series of vibrations through the seat. At the same moment, the brakes automatically clamped down to slow the car.

It ended on Friday afternoon with victory for Glenn Milgrim of Forest Hills, Queens; Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, Queens; and Aaron Silverstein and Chris Willenken of New York. They finished ahead of Franco Baseggio, Martin Fleisher, John Fout, Michael Kopera and Andrew Stark of New York and William Ehlers of West Orange, N.J. Third were Richard Baumer of Holbrook, N.Y.; John Boyer of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; Robert Kuhnreich of New York; and Robert Stayman of New Rochelle. In a board-a-match event, when your two pairs compare scores, if you have a net plus on a board, whether it is 10 points or 1,000, you receive one point. If the scores are identical, you get half a point. A loss is worthless.

They earned the No. 4 seeding in the National Football Conference playoffs and will play the Carolina Panthers in the opening round Sunday at Giants Stadium. The Giants clinched the N.F.C. East title and secured a home game by beating the Raiders, 30-21, on Saturday night in Oakland. But their seeding and wild-card opponent were not determined until yesterday, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers topped the New Orleans Saints at home and Carolina beat the Atlanta Falcons on the road.

Bloomberg promised yesterday to pursue the most ambitious housing program in New York City's history, to begin a national campaign against illegal guns, and to ''lock in and extend'' his program to improve the schools. The address was a stark change from his first inaugural four years ago, when Mr. Bloomberg somberly called for shared sacrifice after the Sept. 11 attack. Yesterday, the mayor declared the city whole again in a boisterous ceremony that was, if anything, a celebration of its recovery and a call to build an even stronger New York.

In those days, it wasn't clear where an indie-rock veteran in love with music machines could find an appreciative audience. Nowadays it's blindingly clear. And so on Friday night, the eve of New Year's Eve, Mr. Maclean could be found at Avalon, the Chelsea nightclub that has taken over the converted church formerly home to the infamously decadent Limelight. He is now known as Juan Maclean, the leader of the computer-enhanced project he calls the Juan Maclean. And during a brief set on Friday night, some revelers paid him the compliment of watching and applauding, while others paid him the greater compliment of turning around and dancing.
2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;WHAT'S ON TONIGHT;None;The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;Schedule;8 P.M. (Court) BEACH PATROL -- Series premiere. So much for a channel devoted to courtroom drama. This is one of three original reality series that Court TV is introducing this month. It's all about the daily experiences of San Diego lifeguards (above), whose jobs involve a lot more than rescuing swimmers and controlling rowdy teenage drinkers. There are also missing-persons cases, fights and murders. All the good stuff. 8 P.M. (ABC Family) WILDFIRE -- Season premiere. ''Try It Without the Porsche.'' Kris (Genevieve Cortese), juvenile delinquent turned horsewoman, is suddenly a celebrity because of her performance in the Sandpiper Classic, the big race. Junior (Ryan Sypek), her love interest, drives his car into a lake. 8 P.M. (FOX) ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT -- The Bluth family has certainly had its troubles, so maybe George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) isn't completely crazy to suggest holding a fund-raiser for themselves. Andy Richter guest-stars in this new episode as the celebrity they decide should be the event's M.C. Then, at 8:30, ''Ready, Aim, Marry Me,'' a February 2005 episode, has two big guest stars: Liza Minnelli and Martin Short. 9 P.M. (Lifetime) MAID OF HONOR -- (2006). Laci (Linda Purl, right) seems to be one of those selfless, self-sacrificing women. After her sister dies, she moves in with her brother-in-law (Linden Ashby) and his two children to take care of them. Things go beautifully until the brother-in-law proposes to another woman, and the truth comes out: Laci loves him, wants him for herself and will do anything to prevent this marriage. 10 P.M. (NBC) MEDIUM -- As a professional psychic, Allison (Patricia Arquette) is always having awful dreams and premonitions, but now she can't get one man out of her mind: a psychotic murderer who kills young women and takes scalpels to them. Allison's husband becomes very worried about their two daughters. 10 P.M. (A&E) ROLLERGIRLS -- Series premiere. To many movie fans, Roller girl can refer only to Heather Graham's pornstar character in''Boogie Nights.''But in Austin, Tex., things are different. The TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls are roller derby stars. They have names like Miss Conduct (left),Venis Envy and Punky Bruiser, and this is the reality series built around their competitions.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Skating and Punching Their Way to Self-Esteem;Alessandra Stanley reviews A&E TV reality series Rollergirls; photos (M);The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;Review;For a while, it seemed as if Roller Derby was a lost art, like illuminated manuscripts or clog dancing. Actually, it's more like polio: many people assume it was eradicated in the 1970's, but it's still around and, in some areas, quite virulent. ''Rollergirls,'' a documentary-style reality series about Texas Roller Derby that has its premiere tonight on A&E, is proof that the spectacle sport never went away entirely; it just drew less attention. There was a reason interest faded, and ''Rollergirls'' is also proof of that.

The dispute comes a year after the Orange Revolution brought a pro-Western government to power in Ukraine. It ends a decade of post-Soviet subsidies in the form of cheap energy that allowed Russia to retain some influence over the former Soviet republics.

Ratko Mladic. According to investigators here and in the Netherlands, Mr. Karadzic and General Mladic, who have been indicted on charges of genocide at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, are considered war heroes among Serbs, just as Mr. Gotovina was among Croats. They, like him, have received protection from a network of nationalists, members of the secret services and criminals, the investigators say.

The many celebrations of the bicentenary of the battle of Trafalgar last fall were a reminder that Horatio Nelson, who died from a sniper's bullet while leading his fleet to victory, is the greatest of all British heroes -- the inspiration for more tea towels, pottery figurines and ceremonial spoons than anyone else not a member of the royal family. The closest analogue Americans have is Nelson's near-contemporary George Washington, 26 years older, but the comparison almost immediately falters.

2006-01-02T00:00:00Z;Magnus;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;I have learned enough about farming -- or at least living on a farm -- over the past eight years to begin to understand the wisdom of the old farmers I know. They are wise because everything has already happened to them. The barn has burned down. The cows have trampled the cornfield. A finger has vanished into the combine. The soybean market has gone south. If the very worst hasn't happened to one farmer, it has happened to the neighbor down the road. A lot of the surprise has gone out of life. One of the reasons farmers like talking to my wife, Lindy, and me is that they can see that we still have plenty of surprise left in us. I have one basic anxiety about living on a farm. In my worst nightmare, all of the animals escape at once, and they are all tangled in the fence and are rolling in a ball down the highway. So I will just say that the other day Magnus, our 300-pound Tamworth boar, got out. I looked out the attic window, and Magnus was loping after the horses in the big pasture. This is one of those spots where a book like ''Five Acres and Independence'' really lets you down.

Asked about Iraq at the time, she said she was far more concerned about the rigors of basic training and more focused on the fear that she might wind up here, in her hometown of 1,000, never amounting to much. The local recruiter made her parents, Byron and Mary, feel comfortable, too, they said. They hoped the conflict in Iraq would fade away by the time their only child finished training, Mr. Jordan said back then, on the same afternoon that his freckle-faced daughter marched across the Lyndon High gymnasium in flip-flops to collect her diploma. ''We don't think she is going to be in a battle zone,'' he said that day.

But so intensely involved is Angela Gheorghiu in even the most overripe operatic repertory that her New Year's Eve with the New York Philharmonic ended up more a musical event masquerading as a star turn. Not that the diva stayed home. Ms. Gheorghiu, the Romanian soprano -- a knockout to look at, gorgeously and variously clothed, showing a big smile and a little leg, and radiantly confident in her divine right to be admired -- swept on and off the stage, emanating an aw-shucks graciousness that she might well add to her other operatic roles.

Stability control systems have become ever more capable of catching spins before they end in a crash; brakes can now be programmed to recognize panic stops and apply maximum force for hesitant drivers. BMW's ''active steering'' will counter a driver's overly aggressive moves at the steering wheel in an emergency maneuver, and Infiniti offers a system that warns when the car is drifting toward an adjacent lane -- and a possible fender-bender.

Those roles have been reversed. Japan's global market share is now half of what it was then, while Intel of Santa Clara, Calif., has risen to become the world's largest and most profitable chip maker. Indeed, Intel and Samsung Electronics, a South Korean company that was not even in the picture in Japan's glory days, together have a market share as large as the combined shares of the 20 large Japanese chip makers tracked by the research firm iSuppli.

Yesterday and today, ballots for the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild were due back for counting, with the Directors Guild's coming in the next day. In fact, there's been so many ballots papering the sprawling reaches of L.A. that it seems a bit like Cold War Soviet Union, with people madly engaging in voting of all sorts, sometimes more than once.

"Narnia" is galloping by "Kong" at the box office, which does not bode well for the monkey's finishing game at the Oscars. Guess that's what happens when you go up against a mythical character who is serving as a stand-in for God? The box office figures matter because Academy members are human, or at least as close as you can get in Los Angeles, and if audiences saw "Kong" as a celebration of the muscle and sheer magnitude of industry might, it might build steam in the Academy. As it is, audiences, especially kids, seem to be feeling a bit hung over after drinking in all the visual excess. One too many dinosaurs will do that to you. "Kong" will get its share of Kodak moments on Oscar night - although the movie may be a little too too, there is far too much virtuosity to ignore - but it may not get to thump its chest when Best Picture or Best Director get announced. But don't just listen to the Bagger look to the Director's Guild nominations this Thursday and see if Peter Jackson elbows his way in. (Terrence Malick took the hint that too much of a good thing is still too much and took a scissors to "The New World" at the last minute.)

Given the pressure on rooms -- most hotels are insisting on tearing off both arms for a few nights stay during the Oscars -- and the crows on a wire that watch over his expenses, it looks like the Bagger will be spending Oscar weekend at an inn that one of his colleagues compared unfavorably to the Hotel Rwanda. It will go well with the tux made of asbestos that he bought from Syms. Maybe I can get "In Her Shoes" on pay-per-view while I'm there to finish off the trauma.

Now "The New World," "Brokeback Mountain," and "Munich" are rolling out across all sorts of zip codes. And mark the Bagger's word, you are going to be hearing a lot more about "Match Point." For all the inside industry chatter about Woody Allen, left, being back, it is far more important that audiences seem to be showing up for the bloody romance movie. The crowd-pleasing gimmick embedded in the film, along with a contemporary resonance that brings to mind "Closer," makes Mr. Allen's conflicted backstory and string of box office also-rans seem far less important. Speaking of which, now that the Bagger's horde of readers has actually seen some of these movies, let's hear from you about Best Picture if you dare. Is "Syriana" toast? Can "Match Point" sneak in? Will "Kong" get gonged? Is "Brokeback" Peaking Too Early or Just Plain Unbeatable? Is "Geisha's" makeup beginning to run? Will "History of Violence" make a historic comeback? And don't forget about the little guys, "Capote" and "Good Night."

The film wonk promptly asked the Bagger who he thought should win Best Supporting Actress, and stumped him, leading to enormous personal humiliation he would prefer not to discuss. Let's just say it won't happen again, because the Bagger has been reading up at And The Oscar Goes To where he learned Way Too Much about the semiotics and subtext of supporting roles in the distaff hemisphere. Meanwhile, over at Fox 411, Roger Friedman says Felicity Huffman is the girl to beat in a leading role.

While Ms. McKay had been negotiating for some time with the label over the length and final song selection of ''Pretty Little Head'' -- which was supposed to be released today -- she says the decision not to put out the album was a result of a recent executive shake-up at Columbia, and ''had more to do with my personality'' than with the album itself. The London-born, Harlem-based Ms. McKay had been fighting with the label over her insistence on a 23-song, 65-minute version of the album; Columbia was pressing for a 16-song, 48-minute version. (The two-CD ''Get Away From Me'' has been called the first double-disc set ever released by a debut artist.) At recent shows, Ms. McKay had given out the personal e-mail address of the Columbia chairman, Will Botwin, from the stage, encouraging fans to lobby him for the release of the longer album. ''I thought we had resolved things favorably,'' Ms. McKay said. ''We were just finalizing the artwork.''

Nielsen ratings for Ms. Van Susteren, left, rose for the year in both total viewers, with an average of 1.75 million each night, and in adults 25 to 54, the demographic advertisers aim for on television news. On Nov. 7, CNN's ''Anderson Cooper 360'' made its debut in the 10 p.m. hour; between then and Christmas, ''On the Record'' soundly beat it, more than doubling ''360'' in total viewers. But when compared with the same period in 2004, ''360'' has improved CNN's ratings from 10 p.m. to midnight, while Fox's numbers have decreased in the younger demographics. Among viewers 25 to 54, ''On the Record'' was down 36 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, while ''360'' ratings rose 17 percent for the time period. At 11 p.m., rebroadcasts of ''The O'Reilly Factor'' have also easily beaten ''360,'' but have similarly lost 25-to-54-year-olds when compared with the show's 2004 ratings. KATE AURTHU

Now, at 76, the amiable Hungarian finds himself revisiting the experience as the writer of the script for a movie, also ''Fateless.'' ''How can you not be touched by seeing your own story?'' asked Mr. Kertész, who won the 2002 Nobel prize for literature. ''I think the film is very beautiful, but it is not the book. The film is a visual thing. The child awakens immediate sympathy. The text should play a secondary role to the action and images.''

But S. gregaria's destruction is limited to the Middle East, Africa and western Asia; it is the only locust found in the Old World. The other 50-odd species in the genus are found in the Americas. Biologists have long wondered how this separation happened. Because the desert locust, in particular, is such a long-distance traveler, some scientists think the New World locusts must be descended from desert locusts that crossed the Atlantic ages ago. But others say S. gregaria is so closely related to a group of American locusts that it probably originated in the New World, a single lineage having crossed the ocean fairly recently.

The walled-in courtyard of Sacred Heart Church here was packed Monday with men and women searching for a blanket, a meal, a place to live, word of a lost relative, anything that might help rebuild a life after the police charged their camp on Friday.

Rap Sheets Saying they lacked sufficient evidence to try the rapper Gucci Mane, prosecutors in Georgia have dropped a charge of murder against him, The Associated Press reported. He had been accused of the shooting on May 10 of Henry Lee Clark III, a rapper from Macon, Ga. Mr. Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, said he shot Mr. Clark in self-defense after being attacked by him and four other men. Mr. Mane, right, is in jail in Atlanta after pleading no contest to charges that he assaulted a promoter, Troy Buffer, with a pool cue in June. Mr. Mane was sentenced to six months in jail and six and a half years' probation; he also agreed to pay medical bills of about $3,000. Mr. Mane's lawyer said he should be released this month. The rapper Pimp C, half of the million-record-selling Texas duo Underground Kingz, or UGK, has been released from prison in Texas, The Associated Press reported. Pimp C, whose real named is Chad Butler, was paroled after serving about half of an eight-year sentence for aggravated assault. He will be on parole until December 2009.

I was pleased with the way the performer engaged audience members by talking to them between numbers, using a hand-held microphone; and the audience seemed responsive and involved. A week or so later, I spoke on the phone to a friend I had run into at the concert and asked him what he and his wife had thought of it. I wondered if they had found the approach distressingly populist. ''Well,'' my friend said, ''we liked the music; but as for the talking, we couldn't understand a single word he said.'' We think of concerts as fixed entities. In our age of mechanical reproduction, live performance has become -- like a book, a movie, a painting -- an object that can be recorded, examined and stamped with approval (or disapproval). So we tend to think that everyone who attends the same performance is hearing the same thing.

But I was stopped in my tracks by the time I arrived at: ''The moms, professors, had done it before, often many times. The birth canal for them was like a water slide.'' Had the writer spoken to the moms (and indeed, he could not since another med student was often holding a mask over their faces), I doubt they would have used quite that metaphor.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;Voting Inequities;None;Editorial Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: Re ''Phantom Voters, Thanks to the Census'' (editorial, Dec. 27): It is true that the communities of origin for many prisoners are disenfranchised when their incarcerated members are counted as living in remote prisons when districts are drawn up. Around the country, the political power of the largely white, rural districts where prisons have been built in the last 30 years is unfairly amplified by nonvoting prisoners.

Everywhere investors looked, it seemed, the sky was on the verge of falling. Wall Street worried as the Federal Reserve pushed short-term interest rates higher and the yield curve flattened. There were concerns that consumers would reduce spending as gasoline prices surged after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast. All the while, many fretted about a bubble in housing and the impact if that bubble popped or slowly deflated.

GAME OF THE YEAR -- In an age of desultory finals, Liverpool and A.C. Milan gave the world a display of the game at its absolute, pulsating best on a May evening in Istanbul. Liverpool's victory in the European Champions League final may have been settled on penalty kicks, but the shootout at the end of 120 minutes of open play can never obscure the six minutes of madness when Liverpool erased a 3-0 deficit to tie the score early in the second half.

Putin and Russia, 2006 was supposed to be a banner year. Instead, it has begun badly, and with problems of the Kremlin's own making. The Kremlin, which labored in 2005 to distance itself from the ill will that accompanied its destruction of the Yukos oil company and the bungled handling of the rigged Ukrainian presidential election in 2004, has begun the new year with a display of politics and bullying, followed by partial retreat, that is raising fresh questions about its reliability as an international energy partner.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;As Argentina's Debt Dwindles, President's Power Steadily Grows;None;Foreign Desk;article;News;Just four years ago, Argentina's economy was prostrate and its politics in chaos, after a financial crisis resulted in bank deposits being frozen, the government defaulting on more than $100 billion in debt and five presidents holding office in two weeks. But on Tuesday, the country is expected to pay off the last of its debt to the International Monetary Fund and simply walk away from further negotiations with the group. Argentina still owes tens of billions to private lenders, even after a debt restructuring in March. But the $9.8 billion payment is an important symbolic milestone and just one of several recent signs that President Néstor Kirchner appears to be concentrating more power in his own hands and steering his government to the left. Since a midterm election victory in October, Mr. Kirchner has also moved to establish an alliance with Venezuela's populist leader, Hugo Chávez, and, as a traditional Peronist, to extend the hand of the state deeper into the economy, the judiciary and the news media.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;A Fair Day's Pay;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;The federal minimum wage has been a paltry $5.15 an hour for more than eight years. Polls show that there is strong popular support for raising it, but Congress has resisted. Unions, community groups and advocates for the poor are increasingly taking the matter directly to voters through state referendums to raise their states' minimum wages, according to an article yesterday in The Times. Their intentions are laudable, but the efforts only highlight Congress's failure to set the federal minimum wage at a reasonable level. The federal minimum wage got its start in 1938, when the Fair Labor Standards Act required the employers it covered to pay workers at least 25 cents an hour. Because the law is not indexed for inflation, Congress has to pass legislation to increase the minimum wage. Its record of doing this is disappointing. The last time the minimum rose was in September 1997. Since then, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the minimum wage's purchasing power has fallen more than 15 percent. It is now less than one-third of the average wage for private nonsupervisory workers -- the lowest percentage in 56 years.

Officials of the state-owned Russian company, Gazprom, presented the decision not as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine's ''theft'' of natural gas. But it became clear almost immediately that the driving force in Russia's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe, including countries like Germany that are usually reliable allies.

The group, the Iraqi Consensus Front, also said it would abandon claims that national elections last month had been rigged once international election monitors finish their review of the allegations. The move drew a rebuke from other Sunni Arab political leaders who accused the Sunni consensus party of violating an agreement to press ahead with claims of Sunni disenfranchisement during the vote on Dec. 15 and to not bargain on their own for a role in the new government.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;In Charity, Too, the Rich Get Richer;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;MONEY is the mother's milk of disaster relief. And over the last 12 months -- with the Indian Ocean tsunami, the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast and the Pakistan earthquake -- fund-raising records have been broken by the King Kong of relief agencies, the American Red Cross, and by many smaller organizations as well. While much of this money goes to worthy rescue and rebuilding projects, most Americans are unaware that a shocking amount never ends up helping the people it was intended for. In some cases, agencies take in so much aid that they simply cannot spend it all on one disaster. Sometimes the newly flush groups do little because they have no significant history of working in the stricken area or no experience dealing with a particular type of disaster. Worse, some agencies use the money to push agendas that have little to do with victims' immediate needs.

So for four years, the Bush administration put more creative energy into name-calling than into serious talks. The main result was that the North moved four years further along toward being able to threaten its neighbors with nuclear weapons. Then last summer, Washington toned down its language and tried the harder road of diplomacy. The result, in September, was a breakthrough accord in which North Korea committed itself in principle to dismantling its nuclear weapons programs, returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and admitting international nuclear inspectors. It was a deservedly proud moment for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her top Asian deputy, Christopher Hill, whose toughness and diplomatic professionalism helped secure acceptable terms.

With the dismissals yesterday of Houston's Dom Capers, Green Bay's Mike Sherman, New Orleans's Jim Haslett and St. Louis's Mike Martz, the list of head-coaching vacancies ballooned to seven. More could be on the way, with Oakland's Norv Turner probably the next to go. Detroit fired Steve Mariucci on Nov. 28, Mike Tice was fired by Minnesota minutes after his team beat Chicago in the season finale Sunday, and Dick Vermeil retired from Kansas City, reigniting speculation that Jets Coach Herman Edwards could be on their list of candidates.
2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;NEW RULES SET FOR GIVING OUT ANTITERROR AID;None;National Desk;article;News;Facing cuts in antiterrorism financing, the Department of Homeland Security plans to announce today that it will evaluate new requests for money from an $800 million aid program for cities based less on politics and more on assessments of where terrorists are likely to strike and potentially cause the greatest damage, department officials say. The changes to the program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, are being driven in part by a reduction in the overall pool of money for antiterrorism efforts. For 2006, Congress has appropriated $120 million less in these urban grants than for 2005.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;MEMO PAD;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;AIR À LA CARTE -- Remember when department stores delivered your purchases, and travel agents booked your trip, at no charge? It may not be long before we start asking the same nostalgic question about the good old days of air travel, according to Terry Trippler, the airline analyst at Cheapseats.com. Among the services that carriers may soon start charging for, he says, are advance and choice seat assignments, pillows and blankets, and even checked bags. One airline, American Eagle, recently said it would charge $1 for soda or juice on flights within California. Can pay toilets be far behind? DISCOUNTS ON SHORT HOPS AT AMERICAN -- American Airlines has reduced the number of AAdvantage frequent-flier miles required for award travel on nonstop flights under 750 miles one way (for example, Chicago to Atlanta). During the slow business travel season through Feb. 28, domestic coach seats on those flights can be claimed, when available, for 15,000 miles round trip, a reduction of 10,000 miles from the normal cost. First- or business-class travel will cost 30,000 miles, 15,000 miles less than the old price. American made the same offer this time last year, and 80,000 short-hop trips were claimed. LATIN AMERICA UPGRADES ON DELTA -- Delta Air Lines passengers with Medallion status can now get free upgrades to business class, subject to seat availability, on flights to and from major destinations in Latin America, the airline announced. ''This new benefit fits our international expansion,'' said Jeff Robertson, managing director of Delta's SkyMiles frequent-flier program, which awards Medallion elite status at three levels for those flying the required number of miles annually (75,000 for platinum, the top level). Delta increased its capacity 30 percent for flights to Latin America and the Caribbean in the last year. Most airlines limit free elite upgrades to domestic flights. NEW BUSINESS CLASS FOR LAN -- In March, LAN Airlines is to join the ranks of international carriers that have eliminated first-class cabins and made major improvements in their business class. The airline is refurbishing business-class cabins on its long-haul 767-300 fleet on flights between North America and South America to add lie-flat seats and is improving its in-flight entertainment. LAN calls the new service Premium Business. JOE SHARKEY

A resident of Palm Beach, FL, who summered for nearly sixty years at the family compound she and her husband began on Great Pond in Belgrade Lakes, ME, she was a woman of immense charm and grace who devoted her life to her beloved family.

2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;Question for Judge Alito: What About One Person One Vote?;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;When Samuel Alito Jr. applied for a top job in the Reagan Justice Department, he explained what had attracted him to constitutional law as a college student. He was motivated, he said, ''in large part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.'' The reapportionment cases that so upset young Mr. Alito were a series of landmark decisions that established a principle that is now a cornerstone of American democracy: one person one vote. There has been a lot of talk about the abortion views of Judge Alito, President Bush's Supreme Court nominee. But his views on the redistricting cases may be more important. Senator Joseph Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who will be one of those doing the questioning when confirmation hearings begin next week, said recently that Judge Alito's statements about one person one vote could do more to jeopardize his nomination than his statements about Roe v. Wade.

It is an appealing image but useless for the task at hand. Dr. Johnson is looking for the telltale features of fetal alcohol syndrome. For that, he needs a photo of Dmitry, expressionless, looking directly into the camera. Dr. Johnson, a pioneer in the growing field of adoption medicine, is trying to assess the health and well-being of Dmitry for a family considering adopting him. Given the increasing understanding among adoption experts of the health risks facing orphans in certain developing countries, scanning a photo of a child has become a common practice, more reliable for finding abnormalities like fetal alcohol syndrome, which smooths the groove between mouth and nose, than for detecting imperceptible risks, like attention deficit disorder.

But amid all the things that have gone wrong on the Gulf Coast, the repair of the crucial highway has gone unusually right, coming in ahead of time and under budget. By cannibalizing one bridge to fix the other, and then using temporary steel spans to fix the first bridge, the State of Louisiana and the contractor were able to open one span in October and plan to have traffic flowing on the other as early as Jan. 6, nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.

The man, Lovell Moody, 27, of Bergen Street, was shot once in the head about 12:45 a.m. and died two hours later at Bellevue Hospital Center, the police said. After the shooting, the car's driver, who was not identified, sped away but pulled over several blocks south to call 911, the police said. FERNANDA SANTOS (NYT)
2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;Home, Away From Home;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;Larry King, the CNN talk show host, describes himself as a creature of habit. On his monthly trips to New York from his home base in Los Angeles, he always stays at the same suite at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan, requests the same bittersweet chocolates to be ready in his room (for his heart condition), orders the same item from room service (tomato soup) upon arrival, keeps the same workout gear and business suit stored there and even has the same hotel driver pick him up from the airport.

The report, issued late last month by the department's Office of Inspector General, found that biotechnology regulators did not always notice violations of their own rules, did not inspect planting sites when they should have and did not assure that the genetically engineered crops were destroyed when the field trial was done.
2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;The Lesson of Enron;None;Editorial Desk;article;Letter;To the Editor: The lesson you want business leaders to learn from the Enron debacle is ''that sometimes excessive greed doesn't pay'' (''Enron Rears Its Head Again,'' editorial, Dec. 29)? The lesson they understand quite well is that it obviously pays handsomely, most of the time, without the risk of going to jail, and it will continue to do so. What we could do, however, to strike a blow at greed is increase the marginal tax rate to capture most of the undeserved, astronomical earnings of business leaders. We might also tax corporate earnings at a higher rate if corporations choose to reward executives with salaries and bonuses exceeding a certain percentage of earnings.
2006-01-03T00:00:00Z;Running on Empty;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;THE rise in fuel prices that followed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has prompted many members of Congress to call for new and expanded federal reserves of crude oil, diesel fuel, home heating oil, jet fuel and propane. Proponents of stockpiling claim that if the government were to hoard those commodities when prices were low, it could unleash them on the market when supplies are tight, thus dampening price increases and stabilizing the market. But the experience in this country with the strategic petroleum reserve strongly suggests that such government-managed stockpiles are a waste of taxpayers' money. Rather than increasing the stockpile, the reserve should be emptied and closed.

Wade, and the other on Mitchell v. Forsyth, which addressed the attorney general's personal liability for wiretaps found to violate the Constitution. Determined to fit the man to the Scalito caricature with which they hope to defeat his nomination to the Supreme Court, Judge Alito's detractors ignore the context and the content of both documents.

Untreated, the condition can cause permanent vision loss in the affected eye. But researchers say they have found a way to help people with lazy eye who are in their late teens or older. The study, led by Yifeng Zhou of the University of Science and Technology of China, appears in the journal Vision Research.

He is zooming along on the Acela, a "high-speed" train between Washington and New York that looks fast and brawny, but is really not that much quicker than the traditional conveyance. There's a metaphor for Hollywood in here somewhere, but the Bagger is too pooped to figure it out. The dial-up on the train - thank you, Verizon - may not set any speed records either, but at least it allows the Bagger to keep track of his plot to take over the world, along with his new hobby of obsessively tracking every wiggle and wobble of the Oscar race. He has noticed that "A History of Violence," which was not getting much play a month ago, seems to be surging. And he is not the only one.

Under a proposal by the Treasury Department and legislation introduced last year by Ohio Republican Michael Oxley and Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, the Bank Holding Company Act would be amended to allow financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries of national banks to act as agents for buyers and sellers of property and to list property for sale.The NAR vehemently opposes the change and has been successful in blocking it so far. When President Bush signed the Transportation, Treasury and HUD spending bill on November 30, 2005, it contained a one year prohibition against the proposal that would allow banking interests to operate real estate brokerage, leasing and property management businesses. The NAR says that this is the fourth year the organization has been successful in blocking the changes. The battle between two of Washington's most powerful interest groups promises to continue in 2006. According to campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics, the real estate industry was the fourth largest contributor to members of Congress during the 2005-2006 session. Commercial banks ranked ninth. -- RON NIXON

Dion DiMucci, the Bronx-born singer known simply as Dion, whose doo-wop and rock hits of the late 1950's and early 60's included ''A Teenager in Love,'' ''The Wanderer'' and ''Runaround Sue,'' is, with Frankie Lymon, one of the defining bookends of the New York style of street-corner singing. Yet the record that set the course of his life was Hank Williams's ''Honky Tonk Blues'' -- a song as far removed from the life of an 11-year-old growing up on 183rd Street as you could find. ''I had no idea what a honky-tonk or jambalaya was,'' Dion said of hearing the record on Don Larkin's country music radio show out of Newark. ''When you're a kid, and your mom is cooking sauce in the kitchen on a Sunday, and this song comes on the radio, and all you can say is, 'Who is that?,' it's hard to say how that stuff moves your insides. But I liked that he sounded so committed. At the end of a sentence, he almost dug into the last word and ripped it off with his mouth.''

[C5.] Oxygen Enlists Agency as Part of Image Makeover The cable network Oxygen is making a move to overhaul its wholesome image with ''Campus Ladies,'' a ribald comedy about two middle-age suburban women who go back to college and indulge in some age-inappropriate partying and carousing with male undergraduates. Helping Oxygen in its image makeover will be Toy, a new boutique agency in New York, which has created an $8 million marketing campaign to introduce the weekly show. The campaign, Toy's first account in its two-month life, combines print, television, subway posters, billboards, online and guerrilla advertising.

But for those who ventured back, the educational landscape was much different from the one they had left: New Orleans is now a smaller system dominated by new charter schools in the same buildings that housed traditional public schools before the storm, as well as by leaner private schools eager for what they hope will be new pools of aid.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Caught Up in a Turf War On Winnipeg's Mean Streets;None;The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;Review;If it does nothing else, ''Stryker,'' a grim little gang melodrama directed by Noam Gonick, might dispel some American assumptions about life in Canada. The streets of Winnipeg, where this crude, punchy picture takes place, look a lot like those in Detroit, Philadelphia or Los Angeles, as depicted in countless hip-hop-inflected movies (more than a few actually filmed in Canada) about the perils and thrill of the thug life. One difference is that there is more snow on the ground. Another is the ethnicity of the gangs battling for control of the drug trade. The central character (Kyle Henry) is a 14-year-old boy from an Indian reservation who comes to Winnipeg by freight train after burning down an abandoned church. He arrives just in time to witness a fight between members of the Indian Posse, a crew led by a swaggering matriarch known as Mama Ceece (Deena Fontaine), and the Asian Bomb Squad, a mostly Filipino outfit whose boss is Ceece's archrival, Omar (Ryan Black).

Though shocked and scared after lying pinned to the ice for nearly eight hours, she was returned unhurt to her anxious parents. But so far, as the search for survivors continued Tuesday, the girl, whose name was not disclosed by the authorities here, is the only survivor found.

The owners are Helen Fioratti and James Sansum, her former protégé. Mr. Sansum, 39, pleaded guilty yesterday to failing to pay income tax on personal purchases, like clothing and his poodle's veterinary bill, that he made using gallery credit cards while working for Ms. Fioratti. Prosecutors said the money should have been declared as compensation. He was sentenced to pay $58,000 in back taxes and to three years' probation.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;His Leverage Secure, the Mayor Continues to Press Public Schools;None;Metropolitan Desk;article;News;Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made clear in his inaugural address that he would continue his push to fix the city's public schools, and over the next four years he will have enormous leverage to do so, empowered not only by mayoral control of the system but also the advantage of a second term. So far, the mayor has given only a few hints of his plans. During his re-election campaign, he pledged to double the number of charter schools in New York City, to more than double the number of children attending public prekindergarten and to radically upgrade the high schools with enhanced job training for the worst students and more elite programs for the best.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Their Eyes Were Reading Smut;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;LAST month I happened to go into the Borders Books store at the Stonecrest mall in Lithonia, Ga., about a half-hour from my house here. To my surprise, it had one of the largest collections of books by black authors that I've ever seen outside an independent black bookstore, rows and rows of bookcases. This is the sort of discovery that makes the pulse quicken, evidence of a population I've spent most of my professional life seeking: African-American readers. What a thrill to have so much space in a major chain store devoted to this country's black writers. With an extra spring in my step, I walked into the ''African-American Literature'' section -- and what I saw there thoroughly embarrassed and disgusted me.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Pirates, Instead Of Orioles, Get Burnitz;Pittsburgh Pirates are expected to sign outfielder Jeromy Burnitz to $6.7 million contract for one year (M);Sports Desk;article;News;Seven years ago, the Baltimore Orioles were responsible for initiating the presigning physical examination that all free agents must have before their contracts can become official. Yesterday, the Orioles lost a free agent, outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, because of the way they enforced the baseballwide policy. Last week, Burnitz agreed to a two-year, $12 million contract with the Orioles. But today he is scheduled to take a physical for the Pittsburgh Pirates, who have guaranteed him $6.7 million for one year and have added a mutual option for a second year that would make the deal worth $12 million for two years.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   STERN, HOWARD S.;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;STERN -- Howard S. The Board of Directors, Executives, and entire staff of AngioDynamics Inc., mourn the loss of Howard S. Stern, co-founder, former chairman of the board of directors, and current director, who passed away at the age of seventyfour after losing his battle with brain cancer. Mr. Stern co-founded AngioDynamics in 1988 as a division of E-ZEM, Inc. He served as a director of the Company since its inception until his death, and was chairman of the board of directors from the Company's start until February 2004. We have lost a remarkable man, a true leader, and a passionate advocate for the development of medical devices to improve patient care. Howard's insight into the possibilities for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease has made a difference in the lives of patients, and in the physicians who treat them. He was instrumental in guiding AngioDynamics from a development stage company to its present position as a publicly-traded leader in innovative products for the peripheral vascular disease marketplace. We will miss Howard dearly, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Parting Liberal Waters Over 'No Child Left Behind';None;Metropolitan Desk;article;News;WILLIAM L. TAYLOR rang in 2006 among the Nobel laureates, heads of state and sundry muck-a-mucks gathered in Charleston, S.C., for Renaissance Weekend, the mother of all networking events. In the weeks ahead, as America marks Martin Luther King's Birthday and Black History Month, he will be speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington and the City Club of New York. His memoir, ''The Passion of My Times,'' (Carroll & Graf, 2004) is about to be reissued in paperback. All this activity for a septuagenarian reflects Mr. Taylor's stature as a grandee of the civil rights movement. His career as a lawyer, lobbyist and government official spanned nearly a half-century. He wrote the legal brief that persuaded the Supreme Court in 1958 to order the integration of Little Rock's public schools, and four decades later, his wavy black hair having long turned into an unruly gray cumulus, he was in court fighting to preserve a desegregation program for the St. Louis region.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Tremors Across the Capital;None;National Desk;article;An Analysis; News Analysis;As a high-flying Republican lobbyist, Jack Abramoff has long been known as a mover and shaker in Washington. But when he cut a deal with federal prosecutors on Tuesday, he shook up this town as never before. Not long ago, Mr. Abramoff was perhaps Washington's most aggressive -- and, at $750 an hour, most highly compensated -- deal maker, a flamboyant man who moved fluidly through the nexus of money and power. Now his decision to cooperate in a broadening corruption and bribery investigation has thrust him into the role of a corporate insider turning against the company that claimed just to be doing business as usual.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Ukraine Concedes It Took Gas From Pipeline but Says It Had the Contractual Right;None;Foreign Desk;article;News;Ukraine conceded Tuesday that it had withdrawn natural gas from its pipeline system that Russia said was intended for export to Europe, but said it had a contractual right to the fuel under an agreement with the Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan. Both Russia and Turkmenistan export natural gas through Russian pipelines to Ukraine, which customarily takes some for its own use and ships the rest on to other European countries. But Russia cut the flow through the pipeline on Sunday, ostensibly in a dispute with Ukraine over pricing and transit fees. That set off alarm bells throughout Europe during the winter heating season and shook world energy markets' confidence in Russia.

Mr. Madonia said in an interview yesterday that the offer from the Rockefeller Foundation was too good to pass up, though, he said, the mayor had already offered him a new job with a ''substantive deputy mayor's portfolio,'' which he declined.

But come Jan. 31, the Boys Choir of Harlem will become a globe-trotting chorale without a home. After more than a decade based at a public school at Madison Avenue and 127th Street, where it helps run the Choir Academy of Harlem, the Boys Choir and its lesser-known sister chorale are being evicted by the city's Department of Education for what the agency describes as a host of financial and managerial improprieties. Although it has always had difficulty raising funds, the choir now faces its most serious crisis since it was founded in the basement of a Harlem church nearly four decades ago.

The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of an esteemed colleague and staunch defender of civil liberties, Frank Wilkinson. For three decades, Frank was subjected to an FBI campaign of surveillance and harassment, spearheaded by J. Edgar Hoover himself. In 1958, Frank was convicted for contempt of Congress, and served 9 months in a Federal prison. He was the plaintiff in the first case to challenge congressional investigating committees as violating first amendment freedoms. He fought that case, in which the ACLU represented him, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1999, Frank received the ACLU's prestigious Medal of Liberty for his tireless work as champion of civil liberties. He will be sorely missed by all who treasure our right to speak freely.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Macaroni and Lots of Cheese;None;Dining, Dining Out/Cultural Desk;article;News;MACARONI and cheese is just the kind of all-American, old-fashioned home cooking I was not raised on. New York City in the 1970's was a hotbed of culinary radicalism. Food-forward parents like mine served dinners of homemade falafel, Mediterranean fish stew or stir-fried beef with broccoli. To me, dishes like spaghetti and meatballs, mashed potatoes with gravy and macaroni and cheese seemed exotic and unattainable.

Keith Haring's Pop Shop is a more recent departure. And as SoHo marches on from artsy neighborhood to open-air mall, it's all but certain that Jamba Juice and its ilk will someday squeeze out the handful of neighborhood standbys like Buffa's Deli and Brisas del Caribe that are still around. When that sad day comes, the one I will miss the most will be La Conquita, a surly, decade-old Dominican lunch spot on the west side of Lafayette Street.

The group, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, said a popular vote could not change a judicial decision.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Two Approaches to Mexican Tradition;None;Dining, Dining Out/Cultural Desk;article;Review;AARÓN SÁNCHEZ spent his boyhood in the heat and hullabaloo of professional kitchens, tied to his mother's apron strings in an almost literal way. When the school day ended, he would head straight to wherever she cooked. In the mid-1980's, that destination was Café Marimba, where his mother, Zarela Martínez, was the executive chef; beginning in 1987, it was Zarela, which she owns. His maturation was marked by the kind of help he was allowed to give her. Before he was 12, he prettied and plated desserts. His salad days came next. After 13, he was allowed to sauté, a rite of passage as eventful for him as getting a driver's license is for another teenager.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Risk Wins a Round Over Politics;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;The Homeland Security Department announced this week that it intended to rely more on the risk of a terrorist attack, and less on politics, when it hands out funds under a key antiterrorism program. This is very good news -- with two caveats. It still remains to be seen precisely how the money will be handed out. And the improvements in this single program do not change the fact that Congress, thanks to the influence of small-state senators, still lets politics play a disturbingly large role in the distribution of other antiterrorism funds. National security experts, including the 9/11 commission, overwhelmingly agree that antiterrorism money should be handed out based on the risk of an attack and the harm it would do. But members of Congress have trouble seeing any program -- even one designed to protect the nation from terrorists -- as above politics and patronage.

Both were 17 when they approached Shamel Garrett on an A train at the Beach 36th Street station on Nov. 28, 2003, and shot him in the back during a robbery, Mr. Brown said.

They yanked the couples by their necks, as though they were so many pesky cats, and slapped them around with their bare hands. The young women shielded their faces with their shawls. The men cowered from the cameras.

The film is not really about cowboys, since there are no cows in the movie. It's really about shepherds.

The revelation of the surplus in the state's $106.7 billion budget led Republicans in the State Senate to speculate that the governor would announce new tax cuts in his address on Wednesday afternoon.

The total tab of $773.75 -- the equivalent of more than $16,000 today -- charged to Abraham Lincoln by the Willard Hotel was so hefty that Lincoln, who stayed there for 10 days before his inauguration, had to wait for his first presidential paycheck to settle it.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Russia Shoots Itself in the Foot;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;If President Vladimir Putin wants to convince the world that Russia is a more reliable energy supplier than the Middle East, playing and losing a game of chicken with Ukraine was not the way to go. Mr. Putin tried to use a pricing dispute between Gazprom, Russia's behemoth, and Naftogaz of Ukraine to punish President Viktor Yushchenko for Ukraine's westward leanings. Instead, he gave Russia another black eye and antagonized Europe. When Gazprom turned down the natural gas spigot a notch, Ukraine simply took what it needed, leaving Europe short of fuel, furious and anxious. That's not a great start for Mr. Putin's turn at the head of the Group of 8, especially since energy security was to be his theme song.

The driver remained in critical condition last night at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, a spokeswoman said. The horse, which had a broken leg, had to be killed, the police said. On a rainy evening when few tourists were taking carriage rides around Central Park, and the driver, Carmelo Vargas, was steering the horse and empty carriage to a stable at 538 West 38th Street, the horse suddenly grew agitated and dashed away, throwing Mr. Vargas from the carriage and crashing into a station wagon at Ninth Avenue and 50th Street. The vehicle's driver and his son were injured, the police said. FERNANDA SANTOS (NYT)

Melissa Clark, a cookbook author, regular contributor and a woman willing to eat a lot of mac and cheese, evaluates some of the better-known brands. Boston Market Macaroni and Cheese (frozen) Of all the brands, this one was actually good, not just acceptable as a quick and unfussy meal for kids or adults. It had an ultracreamy, silky sauce with a true cheese tang and al dente rotelle pasta that stood up to the microwave. It's better than some of the mac-and-cheeses I've sampled in restaurants around town, no faint praise. I've never had the mac and cheese at Boston Market, but if it tastes anything like this frozen version, I'll soon remedy that.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Black Gold or Black Death?;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;IN recent years, one of the toughest turnaround jobs in American industry has been the effort to change the perception of coal from an industrial relic of 19th century to an energy source for the 21st century. The high-water mark of this makeover campaign may well have come last spring, when General Electric began its ''ecomagination'' advertising campaign touting its new clean coal technology. One ad featured glamorous, scantily clad models (male and female) shoveling coal in a dark mine while Tennessee Ernie Ford's version of ''16 Tons,'' the great song about hard labor and corporate exploitation, played on the soundtrack. Near the end of the ad, a voice announced, ''Harnessing the power of coal is looking more beautiful every day.'' But there is nothing pretty about coal, as we have been grimly reminded by the plight of the 13 coal miners trapped by a mine collapse near Tallmansville, W.V. The American Lung Association estimates that 24,000 people die prematurely each year from power-plant pollution. In Appalachia, mountaintop removal mining -- a method of mining in which the mountain is removed from the coal, rather than the coal removed from the mountain -- has flattened some 380,000 acres in the region and destroyed more than 700 miles of streams.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Today's Game;Rose Bowl between Texas University and Southern California University discussed (S)9;Sports Desk;article;News;Texas (12-0) vs. Southern California (12-0) Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif., 8 p.m., ABC College football fans could not ask for a bigger game: the two best teams in the nation face off with the national championship on the line. Southern California is looking to become the first team to win three consecutive national titles and has won 34 games in a row. Texas has won 19 straight games, the second-longest streak in the nation. U.S.C. leads the nation in total offense with 580.25 yards a game. Texas leads the nation in scoring offense, averaging 50.92 points. The Trojans have an array of offensive stars, including two Heisman Trophy winners: running back Reggie Bush and quarterback Matt Leinart. Texas quarterback Vince Young leads the Longhorns' offense. He threw for 26 touchdowns and rushed for 9; he also led the team in rushing with 850 yards. The toughest test for the Trojans this season came against Notre Dame; they needed a rushing touchdown by Leinart with three seconds remaining to pull out a 34-31 victory. U.S.C. also looked beatable against Fresno State before pulling out a 50-42 victory. Texas defeated Ohio State, 25-22, in its second game of the season; it was the Longhorns' only game decided by fewer than 11 points. Texas' defense allowed just 14.6 points a game, tied with Georgia for fourth best in the nation. Tackle Rodrique Wright anchors the defensive front, while Michael Huff is a key in the secondary. The Trojans have an edge with the game being played in California. Three years ago, another 34-game winning streak ended when No. 2 Ohio State beat No. 1 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, 31-24 in double overtime. FRED BIERMAN

The 60's -- a decade that extended well into the 70's in downtown New York performing arts -- was the time of the happening and the be-in and multiple forms of trippy vanguard experimentation. Much of it involved the mixture of media and the enhancement of perception (although, as a priggish critic, I have always taken a disapproving view of perception-enhancement on the job).

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Arts, Briefly;None;The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;News;Byron Manuscript Found ''I just opened the book, and there it was,'' said Susan Stead, a librarian at University College London. What was there was the only known manuscript of a 12-line poem by Lord Byron, left, dated April 12, 1812, speaking of friendship and memory and beginning, ''Absent or present still to thee.'' During routine cataloguing, the manuscript, long assumed lost, was found inside an 1810 edition of ''The Pleasures of Memory'' by Samuel Rogers, a patron of the arts and minor poet who entertained writers, artists, actors and politicians in his salon. Ms. Stead said it appeared that Byron's work, published four years later in a volume of collected poems, was inspired by Rogers's book. Union's Charges Actors' Equity Association announced yesterday that it had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Supper Club and its owner, Martin Thesing. Equity accused the Supper Club in the Hotel Edison, at 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, of refusing to permit the revue ''The Rat Pack Is Back,'' produced, written and directed by David Cassidy (''The Partridge Family''), to continue performances last month because union members were represented in the cast. Equity added that the Supper Club replaced the show with a similar but nonunion production, ''Frank, Dean & Sammy, Live in Concert.'' Mr. Thesing said in a statement, ''The Supper Club is a completely nonunion house and therefore never had any contracts whatsoever with any of the actors in 'The Rat Pack Is Back.' '' 'S Wonderful After 19 million voters had their say in nominating hundreds of sites as successors to the seven wonders of the ancient world named in 200 B.C., a panel of seven judges has narrowed the number of final contenders to 21. Included on the shortlist, The Guardian of London reported, are the Acropolis in Athens; Angkor Wat in Cambodia; the Great Wall of China; the Colosseum in Rome; Machu Picchu in Peru; Stonehenge in England; the Easter Island statues, left; the Kremlin; the Eiffel Tower; and the Statue of Liberty. The New Seven Wonders initiative is an undertaking begun in 2000 by Bernard Weber, a Swiss film producer, author and aviator. Half of the profits from the project, which includes lucrative television deals, are to be used in restoring and preserving monuments around the world. The winners are to be announced on Jan. 1, 2007. And Then There Were Five Contenders for the Whitbread Book of the Year prize dwindled to five yesterday in London, where winners, chosen from 476 entries, were announced in the five awards categories: novel, first novel, biography, poetry and children's book. One of those works will be chosen the Book of the Year, to be announced on Jan. 24, when its author is to receive the grand prize, the equivalent of $43,000. Each of the category winners receives about $8,600. They are Ali Smith, for ''The Accidental,'' chosen best novel; Tash Aw for ''The Harmony Silk Factory,'' best first novel; Hilary Spurling for ''Matisse the Master,'' the second part of her biography of Matisse; Christopher Logue for ''Cold Calls,'' in poetry; and Kate Thompson for ''The New Policeman,'' best children's book. After Hunter S. Thompson Anita Thompson, below, the widow of the flamboyant journalist Hunter S. Thompson, has announced plans to become the co-editor of The Woody Creeker, a magazine expected to make its debut next month, The Associated Press reported. The magazine takes its title from Woody Creek, the Colorado community where the Thompson property is, and Ms. Thompson said it was intended to celebrate the oddities and richness of the locale. She also said she was assembling ''Hunters Wisdom,'' a collection of witticisms, aphorisms and other excerpts from the 14 books by Thompson, who shot himself to death last year. Second Thoughts Submitted to 20 publishers and agents, the typed manuscripts of the opening chapters of two books were assumed to be the work of aspiring novelists. Of 21 replies, all but one were rejections. Sent by The Sunday Times of London, the manuscripts were the opening chapters of novels that won Booker Prizes in the 1970's. One was ''Holiday,'' by Stanley Middleton; the other was ''In a Free State,'' by Sir V. S. Naipaul, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Literature. Mr. Middleton said he wasn't surprised. ''People don't seem to know what a good novel is nowadays,'' he said. Mr. Naipaul said: ''To see something is well written and appetizingly written takes a lot of talent, and there is not a great deal of that around. With all the other forms of entertainment today, there are very few people around who would understand what a good paragraph is.''

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;BASF Bids For Engelhard To Expand Into Car Part;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;The BASF Group of Germany, the world's largest chemical maker, made a hostile takeover bid of $4.9 billion yesterday for Engelhard, an American company that invented the catalytic converter for cars. BASF first approached Englehard, which is based in Iselin, N.J., with an offer in December but was rebuffed. Engelhard, which specializes in manufacturing clean-air technology, yesterday urged that shareholders ''take no action at this time'' on the offer, which would represent almost a 23 percent premium over Engelhard's year-end closing price.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;No Place to Buy an Egg?

''There is no place in this neighborhood to buy bread, eggs, butter and cheese,'' said Mr. DeLuca, left, who lives nearby. ''I found myself hiking over to Dean & DeLuca nearly every day.'' Not that he minded shopping in that store, at Broadway and Prince Streets, which he helped found but where he is no longer involved. The new market, at 508 Greenwich Street (Spring Street), is around the corner from his restaurant, Giorgione. His partner in the new place is Jorge Neves, who owns Pão, a Portuguese restaurant on the same block. Giorgione 508 has a couple of sleek bars, a few tables and a moderately priced Italian menu prepared by Alex Schindler: (212) 219-2444.

Segments of Chinatown like the garment industry have lost 40 to 50 percent of their employment, said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. He announced the zones after signing a memorandum of understanding with Gov. George E. Pataki and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. The 72 existing zones were created by the governor's office. The new zones are the first to be designated by the legislative leaders and the governor. DAVID W. DUNLAP (NYT)

Just 14 days later, after several other investors also emerged with the same demand, the board of the publisher, Knight Ridder, gave in and put the company on the block. Unlike the 1980's, when such challenges might be resisted at all costs, today corporate boards are adjusting to a new reality: the activist investor, armed with a handful of shares and a megaphone, is changing corporate America and the deal-making landscape.

As his big, overstuffed 1,079-page novel, ''Infinite Jest'' (1999), demonstrated, David Foster Wallace can do practically anything if he puts his mind to it. He can do sad, funny, silly, heartbreaking and absurd with equal ease; he can even do them all at once. He can do the Nicholson Baker miniature and the Pynchonian epic with similar panache, and he can do old-fashioned realism and newfangled postmodernism with one hand tied behind his back.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Cronyism and Crises;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Defying early forecasts of easy confirmation, the Senate recessed for the holidays without approving Ellen Sauerbrey, President Bush's lamentable choice to head an important State Department agency that coordinates emergency relief for refugees of foreign wars, persecution and natural disasters. Her nomination has yet to clear the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raising at least a glimmer of hope that she may not get the job. Like all too many Bush appointees, Ms. Sauerbrey has political connections that seem her most obvious credential. A former Maryland state legislator and a twice-defeated gubernatorial candidate, she served as state chairman of President Bush's 2000 campaign. She is a favorite of Mr. Bush's far-right base, having pursued an anti-abortion and anti-family-planning agenda in her current patronage post as the American representative to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.

Thanks to the new evil, trans fat (did anyone really think margarine could be good for you?), we have at least one foot back in the land of Julia Child. Although not all the guilt is gone, there seems to be room to enjoy a good butter-based sauce now and then. And that made me think of one of the darlings of the 1980's, beurre blanc. Back when sauces were being simplified and lightened -- yes, beurre blanc is significantly lighter than many classic French sauces -- beurre blanc was everywhere. Then butter took a dive, and the sauce went underground. Its comeback is overdue.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;On the Subject of Leaks;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Given the Bush administration's appetite for leak investigations (three are under way), this seems a good moment to try to clear away the fog around this issue. A democratic society cannot long survive if whistle-blowers are criminally punished for revealing what those in power don't want the public to know -- especially if it's unethical, illegal or unconstitutional behavior by top officials. Reporters need to be able to protect these sources, regardless of whether the sources are motivated by policy disputes or nagging consciences. This is doubly important with an administration as dedicated as this one is to extreme secrecy.

The night's doubleheader started with a game won by Ohio State against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl, which spilled over into prime time, and West Virginia's Sugar Bowl triumph over Georgia. ABC broadcast both games, which drew an average of 16.78 million viewers from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. CBS scheduled all repeats of its popular Monday lineup, which defeated NBC's all-new programming. But NBC's ''Surface'' (8.58 million), ''Las Vegas'' (11.52 million) and ''Medium'' (12.12 million) combined to take a solid third place throughout the fall on Mondays. With football season over, the network's new competition for second place in midseason will be Fox: ''24'' returns to its lineup in two weeks. On Sunday, ABC's preview episode of ''In Justice,'' a new legal procedural, brought in 10.8 million viewers and was part of the network's victory on a slow holiday night. The series moves to Fridays at 9 p.m. this week. KATE AURTHUR

But on Monday night, when the Met's colorful 1991 production of Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' returned to the repertory, the American soprano Ruth Ann Swenson's captivating performance as Adina was a reminder that she remains a consequential coloratura. At 46, as youthful and energetic as ever, Ms. Swenson sang exquisitely, with flawlessly executed roulades and runs, effortless high notes and unerring pitch.

The action means that the administration is moving swiftly to take advantage of an amendment to the military bill that President Bush signed into law last Friday.

2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   NUSSBAUM, TOBY A.;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;NUSSBAUM--Toby A. Age 66, died January 3, 2006 in New York after a lengthy struggle with pancreatic cancer. To the very end, she lived her life to the fullest, with grace, with dignity, with courage, with beauty and, most of all, with love. Toby was born on May 6, 1939. She grew up in Keene, New Hampshire and graduated from Brandeis University in 1960. While in college, she met her future husband Bernie Nussbaum, who was then a law school student. They married in June 1963 and had three children, Emily, Peter and Frank. Peter married Alexis Tannenbaum and they have two children, Wylie and Levi. Emily married Clive Thompson, and a week before Toby died Emily gave birth to her first child, Gabriel Ezra. Toby was aware of Gabriel's birth and was able to meet him, to her great delight. Toby had two brothers, Jay and Bob Sheinfeld, with whom she was very close, as she was with their spouses, Peggy and Susan, and her nieces, Jennifer, Rebecca, Gwen and Daryl. Toby was also a beloved member of Bernie's extended family, including his mother Molly, his brothers, Albert and Martin, their spouses and children, and Bernie's numerous cousins. When Bernie served as Counsel to the President of the United States in 1993 and 1994, Toby was a tower of strength and, in her own right, a respected and popular figure in Washington. All of her adult life Toby was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs. She was a finance chairman for Congresswoman Nita Lowey in her first race for Congress in 1988. She was selected as an elector in 1992 and voted in the Electoral College for President Clinton. She was an officer of the Westchester County Democratic Party. Toby served on the Board of Trustees of Brandeis University and Westchester Community College. She was deeply involved with UJA-Federation of New York, the Metropolitan Council for Jewish Poverty, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. She served as an officer of her synagogue, Temple Israel Center of White Plains. For many years, she sang in Carnegie Hall as a member of the chorus of the New York Oratorio Society. At her homes in New York and Connecticut, she was a warm and engaging hostess. She was a wonderful and devoted friend to so many. Her husband, her children and her precious grandchildren were the joys of her life. And she was the joy of their lives. She will live forever in their memories and in the memories of so many others. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, January 5, 2006 at 12 noon at Temple Israel Center, 280 Old Mamaroneck Road, White Plains, NY (914 948 - 2800)(www.templeisrae lcenter.org). Contributions may be made in her memory to UJA-Federation of New York, 130 East 59th Street, New York 10022. Goodbye Toby. We will always love you.

The engine then stopped altogether, leaving the two men, who had flown together only twice, to decide in an instant whether to make a run at land or put down in the Hudson. They opted for the river to avoid people and buildings.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Roses By Any Other Name;None;Sports Desk;article;News;Even the most ardent fans of the Southern California football team would struggle to identify Dennis Slutak and Christie Uribe. The same can be said for Texas fans and Cleve Bryant. But it is Slutak, the director of football operations, and Uribe, Coach Pete Carroll's assistant, who quietly help the Trojan football machine run smoothly. That means everything from Slutak's arranging sideline passes for the actor Henry Winkler, a big Trojans fan, to Uribe's organizing the thousands of items that Carroll autographs every week for charity.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;In Commercial Leasing, a State of Balance;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;The year 2005 was generally a good one for both sides of the Manhattan office market. Vacancy rates declined, and that was good for building owners. And rents increased, but at a restrained pace, so those looking to lease space were generally not under intense price pressure. In short, many real estate executives say, neither tenants or landlords currently have the upper hand.
2006-01-04T00:00:00Z;Many Millions In Kickbacks From Tribes;None;National Desk;article;News;The kickbacks from one Indian tribe exceeded $11 million. From another, they surpassed $6 million. In less than three years, Jack Abramoff secretly netted more than $20 million from tribes in five states, a sum close to half of the $43.3 million they paid him and a partner to lobby on their behalf. ''These are staggering numbers, even by Washington standards,'' said Stanley Brand, a defense lawyer who specializes in criminal and ethical matters. ''The big firms do very, very well, but they don't come close to these kinds of numbers.''

It had been the most fulfilling regular season of his nine-year career, and Barber seemed in no hurry to let it end, even if the playoffs and the team bus were waiting.

The writers and producers have weighed in, handing out bon bons and nominations, while the Academy finally gets to quit paying for that help wanted ad for Oscar host. The Bagger has stared down this embarrassment of riches and decided to feature a tooth extraction he enjoyed yesterday. The Cliff Notes version: Toothache in Washington, back to Manhattan for some quality time with dentist. Triage suggested a collapsed filling and nerve damage. The Bagger opted for a medieval solution as opposed to spending thousands. Dr. Mengele smiled when he reached that conclusion and got out something that looked an awful lot like a pliers. Much blood and mayhem ensued. The Bagger's boss once compared aspects of his job to a kind of metaphorical dentistry. The Bagger feels his pain, but he feels his own more. At this rate, the Bagger will soon look like the denizens of certain rural hollows he visited as a young reporter - a smile that featured three teeth, all green and somewhat sideways.

Again with the Cliff Notes: "Crash" roars back to life, getting best pic love from both the writers and producers. But what was missing was pretty interesting. Pity Woody Allen. He makes his most coherent, commercial effort in years, a movie that crackles with contemporary resonance, and the writers stiff him. Woody has been nominated 18 times by the Writers Guild, much of it for self-involved junk that the Bagger would not watch with your eyes. Someone, or a bunch of someones, did not like that movie much at all. Was it the end's cute finish? Who knows? And who knows how much it will matter? The Directors Guild nominations later today will be far more predictive if history is any indication. Teasing apart the rest, "Brokeback" remains a runaway horse, "Kong" and "Munich" continue to founder in those awful middle places, and "Capote" is for real. The directors' nods later today could provide oxygen to "Walk the Line" and "The Constant Gardener." Check back later for more juicy, likely pointless analysis. The Bagger has come to understand that the Oscar process involves people taking a stick and poking at various data points in the process, past the point of all reason, and is happy to participate.

The Bagger could smile and wear beige, wanly admiring Mr. Pond's scoop, except he happened to be on the phone yesterday with Sid Ganis, president of the Academy board, and failed to elicit the fact that Jon Stewart was going to host the awards. Mr. Ganis, who seems like the kind of guy the Bagger would love to split a large tub of popcorn with at an afternoon matinee, sandbagged the Bagger. "Hang in there," he said. "We're getting there." No kidding. Perhaps the Bagger's skills as a inquisitor were impaired by that day's dental work, or maybe he should have brandished that pliers that Dr. Mengele used so effectively, but it would have been hard over the phone. The choice of Mr. Stewart, which the Bagger all but begged for on Tuesday -- reporters always vote the story and Mr. Stewart is a great addition to the narrative -- means that there will be suspense far beyond who is going to win Best Picture when March Madness roles around. Mr. Stewart is an enemy of convention, of industrial folkways, of the mannered back-slapping of the entertainment business. Joaquin Phoenix won't be the only one walking the line on Oscar night. It is instructive to recall that the Magazine Publishers of America paid Mr. Stewart large sums to host a Q & A and quickly found themselves on the wrong end of countless savage and wonderful jokes. Among other tidbits: "The way news is driven today is not through print. I don't consider print media as relevant," he said as the editors and publishers in attendance shifted uncomfortably in their seats. David Zinczenko, the editor of Men's Health, was on the panel, and Stewart asked, "Do the men on the cover always have to be-what's the word-glistening?" He added, "I enjoy Health, yet when I read it, I don't know whether to go to the doctor or rub my nipples." Depending on his mood, Mr. Stewart could make Chris Rock's rather tangy appearance last year seem positively well- mannered.

Mr. Riley, 51, assumes the post as Miami is evolving into a lively visual arts venue, largely as a result of the annual art fair known as Art Basel Miami Beach, which convened for the fourth time last month.

Using eight-inch boning knives with quick precision, they dismember the once-mighty predators, cutting off heads, carving up big slabs of meat, slashing off the tails.

But it was Joaquin Phoenix, the 31-year-old actor who plays Cash in the film ''Walk the Line.'' At the invitation of a Folsom chaplain, he came on Tuesday to the medieval-style prison that Johnny Cash memorialized in song, to revive the country star's legacy and offer modern-day inspiration to the inmates.

New Yorkers have tried broadcasting falcon shrieks, installing beach balls painted with big eyeballs, posting fake owls on cornices, strewing mothballs on roosts, even using Avitrol, a hallucinogenic avicide now outlawed in the state, which made birds ''go on a bad trip, '' persuading their peers to stay away. Those spikes that frustrated landlords install on window sills? The birds will build nests in the middle of them, according to Heath Waldorf, vice president of Bell Bird Control, based in Parsippany, N.J. His company's brochure features a portrait of a pigeon perched saucily atop a fake owl.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;WHAT'S ON TONIGHT;None;The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;Schedule;8:30 P.M. (NBC) FOUR KINGS -- Any series set in an impossibly luxurious Manhattan apartment occupied by people who couldn't possibly afford it is at least theoretically fun. This one, from the creators of ''Will & Grace,'' is about a young man (Josh Cooke, wearing the tie) who inherits such an apartment from his grandmother and invites his three best friends (played by Todd Grinnell, on Mr. Cooke's right; Shane McRae, on his left; and Seth Green) to move in with him. 8 P.M. (NBC) WILL & GRACE -- ''The Sound of Music Sing-Along'' comes to town. (This is a real phenomenon in which audience members give a Julie Andrews movie the ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' treatment, dressing up as nuns, Nazis, whatever.) Will meets a handsome man (Taye Diggs) when he goes to the wrong theater. 8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- Season premiere. Last season's find was the dashing John O'Hurley, who lost to the soap actress Kelly Monaco but defeated her in a postseason rematch. In the new competition, George Hamilton (right, with Edyta Sliwinska) could just equal him for attitude and style. Other celebrities to be partnered with professional dancers include Tatum O'Neal, Tia Carrere, the rapper Romeo and the football star Jerry Rice. 9 P.M. (BBC America) TOUCHING EVIL -- The emotionally disturbed Detective Inspector Dave Creegan (Robson Green) returns to work after a nearly fatal gunshot wound and a tiny nervous breakdown. An American version of this series lasted only one season (2004) on USA, but this is the third-season premiere of the British show. 9 P.M. (CBS) CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION -- ''Werewolves.'' Tonight's murder victim is a man with hypertrichosis, or human werewolf syndrome.

George Pataki of New York, and perhaps for several other governors, this year's opening homilies are rehearsals of sorts for the presidential primary campaign that officially begins in 2008. Mr. Pataki presented himself in a surprisingly straightforward way as a moderate Republican. There was no pandering to the capital punishment crowd. No mention of abortion or gun control. Instead, he refined his place as the Republican green candidate. It's a lonely position, but Mr. Pataki might have considered that to have any chance in the big leagues, he will have to wave his strong record on the environment like a regimental flag.

''The present text divides the French,'' Mr. Chirac said during his annual New Year's address to journalists. ''It must be rewritten. It is not up to the law to write history.'' The law's most criticized passage calls for teachers to emphasize France's ''positive role'' in its colonies, particularly in North Africa.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Envoys Say Gas Crisis Hurt West's Relations With Russia;None;Foreign Desk;article;News;After a year of increasingly troubled relations with Russia, American and European diplomats said Wednesday that President Vladimir V. Putin's decision to withhold natural gas from Ukraine's pipelines had further undercut the West's faith in his government's reliability and raised doubts about his ability to lead the Group of 8 industrial nations this year. The diplomats also said the settlement of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices was a step forward, but said at least some of its elements were worrisome, particularly that it named a Russian company of uncertain ownership as an intermediary in the selling of natural gas to Ukraine.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Baby Boomers, Digging Ben-Gay;None;House & Home/Style Desk;article;News;WHEN baby boomers fell in love with gardening back in the late 1980's, the perennial border almost elbowed the swimming pool aside. Billowing masses of color and old roses were the rage. People dropped Latin names at cocktail parties and compared notes on their Wellies and hand-forged English garden tools from Smith & Hawken. But after years of robust growth nurseries are reporting a decline in sales, which peaked in 2002 at $39.6 billion. Purveyors of seed packets and garden supplies are quietly saying the same thing: although boomers are still gardening, they are slowing down. Their backs are giving out. They're tired of expensive perennials that keel over in a drought.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Honk if You Adore My Child Too;None;Thursday Styles;article;News;OF the many boastful parents Adrienne Zimmet has encountered, the one who really got her goat was a mother who bragged that her adolescent daughter was so smart her teacher said she had a ''gift from God.'' Ms. Zimmet, 53, of West Lake Hills, Tex., said the woman would not stop. '' 'Oh, gifted children. I've got 'em. What am I going to do with my gifted children?' She would literally say that.'' Extreme boasting is something Ms. Zimmet, who has an 18-year-old son, has noticed parents doing more and more in the last decade. ''You want them to just zip it,'' she said. ''It's gauche.''
2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   STERN, HOWARD S.;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;STERN--Howard S. The Board of Directors, Executives and entire staff of EZ-EM, Inc. mourn the loss of Howard S. Stern, co-founder, director and Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern passed away on December 28, 2005 after losing a brave battle with brain cancer. He was 74. Mr. Stern was a pioneer in the field of gastrointestinal imaging. Mr. Stern co-founded EZ-EM in 1962 to develop and market the first unit-dose product to virtually eliminate cross-contamination during the administration of barium sulfate contrast media. Mr. Stern was the holder of several patents. Mr. Stern would dedicate his life to the development of products that improved the diagnosis and treatment of GI disease. During his more than 40 years of leadership with E-Z-EM, he helped introduce a series of important innovations to the field, and in the process established the Company as a recognized name among radiologists around the world. Mr. Stern served as a director of E-Z-EM from the Company's founding until his passing, and also served as the Company's Chairman of the Board from its founding until December 2004, when he was named Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern also served as Chief Executive Officer from the Company's founding until 1990, as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1990 to 1994, and again from 1997 to 2000. At his death, Mr. Stern was also a director of AngioDynamics, Inc., which he cofounded in 1988 as a division of E-Z-EM. He served as the Chairman of the Board of AngioDynamics from that Company's founding until 2004, when it was spun off to E-ZEM shareholders. He was also instrumental in the founding and development of Surgical Dynamics, which was sold to U.S. Surgical in 1996. In 2001, in recognition of his life's work, he was honored with a special award by the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists (SGR) ''in appreciation for his generous support and dedication to the educational mission of the Society.'' Mr. Stern was also active in many charitable causes, particularly at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he endowed a fellowship chair at the School of Chemical Engineering Practice, and supported the Center for Cancer Research. He also was the founding donor of the Center for Patient Partnerships at the University of WisconsinMadison, and also served on the board of trustees of the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation. In honor of his father, he established the Isadore N. Stern Scholarship of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) Education and Research Foundation. Mr. Stern received a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1953 and a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1954, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy from 1955-1958. He is survived by his wife Linda, his children Rachel and Seth, his son-inlaw Peter and his daughterin-law Trisha, and his grandchildren William, Madeleine, and Alexander. Mr. Stern will be long remembered as a true visionary and leader in the field of medical imaging. His desire to improve the methods for the screening and diagnosis of colon cancer was relentless, and his passion to encourage everyone to be screened was never ending. He was a guiding light for all who had the privilege to work with him at E-Z-EM. For over 40 years, this Company grew under his stewardship to become an industry leader and play an important role in advancing treatments for cancer and other diseases of the digestive tract. Mr. Stern's passing is a great personal loss to all of us at E-ZEM, who lost a colleague, a friend, and a mentor. We celebrate his life and are committed to continuing his legacy. He left the world a better place due to his numerous contributions. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Stern family. STERN -- Howard S. The Board of Directors, Executives, and entire staff of AngioDynamics Inc., mourn the loss of Howard S. Stern, co-founder, former chairman of the board of directors, and current director, who passed away at the age of seventyfour after losing his battle with brain cancer. Mr. Stern co-founded AngioDynamics in 1988 as a division of E-ZEM, Inc. He served as a director of the Company since its inception until his death, and was chairman of the board of directors from the Company's start until February 2004. We have lost a remarkable man, a true leader, and a passionate advocate for the development of medical devices to improve patient care. Howard's insight into the possibilities for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease has made a difference in the lives of patients, and in the physicians who treat them. He was instrumental in guiding AngioDynamics from a development stage company to its present position as a publicly-traded leader in innovative products for the peripheral vascular disease marketplace. We will miss Howard dearly, and extend our deepest sympathies to his family.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Career of General in Charge During Abu Ghraib May End;None;Foreign Desk;article;News;The Army career of Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the American commander in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, is coming to an end. General Sanchez has told senior Army officials that he plans to retire, probably this summer, rather than face a bruising Senate confirmation fight over any new assignment, said two senior officials who were granted anonymity because General Sanchez has not made his decision public. As recently as last summer, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was considering elevating General Sanchez to the four-star command overseeing the military's operations in Latin America. The general's promotion would have showcased the nation's highest-ranking Hispanic officer and his compelling personal story of growing up poor in southern Texas and using the military as a bootstrap out of poverty.

My beautiful 30-foot European beech was destroyed in a windstorm when a neighbor's pine tree fell on it. I cannot find another. Can you suggest a source? A. Finding another European beech (Fagus sylvatica) should be easy. It's waiting for it to resemble the old one that may prove difficult. This majestic tree can live a long time, but it also takes a long time to grow: 20 years or more to hit 30 feet, much longer for a mature height of 60 feet or more.

After a 37-yard gain on a pass play, Southern California's Bush tried to lateral the ball while he was being tackled. The only person more surprised than the spectators and the television audience was Brad Walker, the target of Bush's toss, which Texas recovered.

At that price you'd expect it to clean by itself -- and it does. It's the Scooba, and it's a robotic wet mop from iRobot, makers of the Roomba automated vacuum cleaner. Put a pint of cleaning solution and water in Scooba's tank and the 10-pound robot will roam a room of up to 200 square feet, spraying out cleaner, scrubbing with a 1,400-r.p.m. brush, then sucking up the dirty water into a separate tank. The dirty water is emptied into the sink the old-fashioned way, by hand. Under four inches tall, the Scooba will even get under your couch. In a test on a kitchen floor measuring roughly six feet by nine feet, a cleaning took about an hour.

Such has been the case with a long-running evaluation of the Job Corps program. Recent research challenges earlier findings that the Job Corps pays for itself in terms of the benefits to society and gain in earnings for teenage participants, although for 20- to 24-year-olds the benefits still appear to exceed the costs.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;National Briefing | Washington: Bush Fills Pentagon Posts;None;National Desk;article;News;President Bush bypassed the Senate confirmation process for two senior Pentagon officials, using his power of recess appointment to install Gordon R. England as deputy defense secretary and Dorrance Smith as the Pentagon's chief spokesman. The nomination of Mr. England, a former Navy secretary and defense industry executive, had been placed under a hold by senators who wanted to question further his ties to military contractors and decisions to close naval yards in certain Congressional districts. Mr. England replaces Paul D. Wolfowitz, now head of the World Bank. Mr. Smith, whose title will be assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, is a former ABC News producer and has been an adviser in both Bush administrations. His nomination was blocked by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who cited an opinion article Mr. Smith wrote in The Wall Street Journal accusing American television networks of aiding Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;No More Second-Term Blues;None;Editorial Desk;article;Op-Ed;AS George W. Bush's leadership flounders a little more than a year after his re-election, we are seeing a return of an old affliction in American politics, ''second termitis.'' The protracted woes of Richard Nixon's Watergate, Ronald Reagan's Iran-contra affair, and Bill Clinton's impeachment were all, in part, manifestations of that malady. Is there some human failing that affects second-term presidents, like arrogance or sheer fatigue? To some degree, perhaps. But the main problem is not personal but institutional -- or rather constitutional, as embodied by the 22nd Amendment limiting presidential tenure.

When Kingman Ho, a physician, bought a 1,000-square-foot 1960's house in Seattle's Mount Baker neighborhood in May, the sellers figured he would tear it down. But Dr. Ho was so intrigued by some of the house's quirky features, like a child's playpen that converts to a conversation pit for grown-ups, that he devised a way to try to save it.

Filling this space for a couple of weeks while its devoted correspondent travels points elsewhere sounded like a little bit of all right, except my shopping karma hasn't been exactly a marvelous party lately, especially during the holidays.

My best-worst shopping experience involved replacing a cellphone lost during a matinee of the exceedingly long ''King Kong.''

It was the kind of revelation that grabs a corner of the tapestry of this federal city and gives it a big shake. Everything, and everyone, was up for grabs. Ana Marie Cox, a woman who knows her way around a scandal, was having none of it. Having just quit her gig as Wonkette, the scandal-sniffing blogger who bent the rules every time she stepped up to the keyboard, and with her first novel about to hit the stores, she nursed a large Bombay Sapphire martini and made her way through a shrimp cocktail, a filet and potatoes at a back table of the nearly empty Palm, Washington's longtime power restaurant.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Unraveling Syria's Cover-Up;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;Bashar al-Assad faces a moment of truth that he has worked hard to evade. The Syrian dictator has been asked to meet with a United Nations team investigating last February's truck-bomb murder of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. If Mr. Assad stonewalls or refuses to meet with the team, even those Security Council members who have shielded Syria -- like Russia, China and Algeria -- will find it hard to claim that Damascus is cooperating enough to avoid imposing tough sanctions. The heat is rising on Mr. Assad from other quarters as well. Last week, Al Arabiya television broadcast an interview with his former vice president, Abdel-Halim Khaddam, long the ultimate Damascus insider on Lebanon. For two decades, until his forced resignation last June, Mr. Khaddam planned Syria's Lebanon policies for Mr. Assad and his father. In the interview, Mr. Khaddam reported that Bashar al-Assad had personally threatened Mr. Hariri less than six months before the assassination, and noted that approval for such a blatant act of political terrorism could have come only from the highest levels of the Syrian regime.

Sovereign said it was delaying the meeting, typically held in April, until after Aug. 31 so management could ''focus its full attention'' on a complex three-way deal in which it will sell a roughly 20 percent stake to Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain and then use the proceeds to help buy Independence Community Bank, based in Brooklyn.

Mr. Abramoff's plea sent a well-deserved wave of anxiety washing up the Capitol steps, and Alice Fisher, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's criminal division, certainly got everyone's attention when she declared that ''government officials and government action are not for sale'' and suggested that a bigger influence-peddling scandal was about to break.

Both albums had big weekly drops in sales -- Mr. Foxx, above, was down 67 percent, Ms. Blige 74 percent -- but in the post-Christmas retail doldrums, it was enough to remain on top. Eminem's ''Curtain Call: The Hits'' (Aftermath/Interscope) was No. 3 with 186,000. BEN SISARIO

Few mental health experts say widely prescribed attention disorder drugs, which include Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall, are dangerous, but scattered reports of problems have been made. Susan Bro, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, said it had no new information to suggest that the drugs may increase heart risks. The advisory committee's discussion, scheduled for Feb. 9, results from the agency's ''cautious vigilance'' in such an important area of medicine, she said. GARDINER HARRIS (NYT)

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Speculators Turn Away From China, Making Revaluation Less Pressing;None;Business/Financial Desk;article;News;After several years of pouring huge amounts of money into China, speculators have abruptly stopped doing so, reducing somewhat the pressure for the Chinese to revalue their currency and helping to bring inflation down surprisingly sharply. The weakening of attention toward China by international real estate investors and especially by currency traders, economists said, is making it harder for the Bush administration to push the authorities in Beijing to allow their currency, the yuan, to rise against the dollar.
2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;The Sago Mine Disaster;None;Editorial Desk;article;Editorial;In the long history of coal mine tragedies in Appalachia, few have borne the compound misery suffered in Sago, W.Va., where a dozen families were plunged from exultation to furious grief by a false report that their loved ones had survived a deadly mine explosion on Monday. After realizing the calamitous mistake, mining company officials took three hours to confirm the error and tell the truth to the dead miners' families, further devastating the community. Survivors are left with the apology of the company officials and rescuers who eagerly rushed the false word forth. But government investigators must waste no time in ascertaining the actual cause of the blast, for the Sago mine was already notorious for its long list of safety violations and fines.

''At this time, Howard Stern is not a part of the Sirius Canada initial channel lineup,'' said Jeff Roman, a spokesman for the sister service, which began last month. He declined to say if the decision against broadcasting Mr. Stern, right, was intended to avoid conflict with government censors, and added that Sirius Canada will review its lineup on a regular basis. In 1997, ''The Howard Stern Show,'' then originating from the United States via Infinity Broadcasting, was dropped from Canadian airwaves after he fell afoul of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council.

He was there because his pretty-boy partner had already dropped a dime on him. Lying, cheating, stealing, gambling and Indians. By Washington standards, the Jack Abramoff scandal is about as theatrical as you can get without having sex in the headline. (The last scandal here to involve costumes was Abscam: we were due for something that would offer better material for fancy-dress parties than blue dresses and scooters.) Until Tuesday, Mr. Abramoff's elaborate web of corruption was an inside-the-Beltway story: we were the only ones with the patience for it. But nothing simplifies a scandal like a guilty plea. Now, the queasily intricate dance of payoffs, favors and influence-peddling that seems to implicate people from the White House on down has the nation on edge.

Her 70-pound dog started running, and Ms. Offerman felt the line go tight as she rocketed down the snowy trail.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;What's Next;None;House & Home/Style Desk;article;News;LETTERFRACK, a bleak and boggy village in western Ireland, was once best known for a reform school run by the Christian Brothers that was rife with physical and sexual abuse. Some 100 boys died there in its 87 years of operation, before it finally closed in 1974 -- a dismal record even by the standards of church-run Irish reformatories. Thirteen years later, when the Letterfrack Furniture College opened, it could not afford a new building, and instead took up residence in the prisonlike, seemingly haunted reform school. It was an odd start for an institution intended to reverse the depressed town's fortunes, and for several years the college operated on a meager budget with a skeletal staff, offering vocational training in furniture design and production to local students. But now Letterfrack is becoming famous for the furniture college, which as of 2002 has a stylish modern campus designed by the celebrated Dublin architecture firm O'Donnell & Tuomey. The school, now known for the exceptional quality of its graduates' wood furniture, attracts applicants from all over Ireland and Europe.

To describe the car in ''El Carro'' as ''cherry red'' is a bland understatement; Radioactive Robitussin is more like it. The Velez family couldn't care less so long as the thing goes. Happily housed in the middle class, they reckon keys to a car, any car, will further their social ambitions. After much bickering, some creative accounting and a detour into petty theft, they all plunk down for the eponymous jalopy. ''El Carro'' is the story of how members of the Velez clan drive, and are driven by, their wild new wheels. Divided into brisk episodes, the movie is a sequence of moral tales and comedic set pieces involving various mishaps, goof-ups, temptations and triumphs. The libidinal patriarch grapples with an adulterous hottie in the passenger seat; the teenage son woos his sweetheart to a disastrously humiliating result; the punky daughter has a ''Thelma & Louise'' moment.

So, too, did the music of Ricky Martin. Can telenovelas do the same? Telenovelas are melodramatic, episodic TV programs, broadcast in Spanish, with sex-drenched stories centered on impossible love affairs, implacable enemies and insoluble family problems. They are hugely popular in Latin America as well as among viewers of United States networks that cater to Hispanic viewers like Telemundo and Univision, which run telenovelas previously seen in countries like Colombia and Mexico.

2006-01-05T00:00:00Z;Paid Notice: Deaths   NUSSBAUM, TOBY A.;None;Classified;article;Paid Death Notice;NUSSBAUM--Toby A. Age 66, died January 3, 2006 in New York after a lengthy struggle with pancreatic cancer. To the very end, she lived her life to the fullest, with grace, with dignity, with courage, with beauty and, most of all, with love. Toby was born on May 6, 1939. She grew up in Keene, New Hampshire and graduated from Brandeis University in 1960. While in college, she met her future husband Bernie Nussbaum, who was then a law school student. They married in June 1963 and had three children, Emily, Peter and Frank. Peter married Alexis Tannenbaum and they have two children, Wylie and Levi. Emily married Clive Thompson, and a week before Toby died Emily gave birth to her first child, Gabriel Ezra. Toby was aware of Gabriel's birth and was able to meet him, to her great delight. Toby had two brothers, Jay and Bob Sheinfeld, with whom she was very close, as she was with their spouses, Peggy and Susan, and her nieces, Jennifer, Rebecca, Gwen and Daryl. Toby was also a beloved member of Bernie's extended family, including his mother Molly, his brothers, Albert and Martin, their spouses and children, and Bernie's numerous cousins. When Bernie served as Counsel to the President of the United States in 1993 and 1994, Toby was a tower of strength and, in her own right, a respected and popular figure in Washington. All of her adult life Toby was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs. She was a finance chairman for Congresswoman Nita Lowey in her first race for Congress in 1988. She was selected as an elector in 1992 and voted in the Electoral College for President Clinton. She was an officer of the Westchester County Democratic Party. Toby served on the Board of Trustees of Brandeis University and Westchester Community College. She was deeply involved with UJA-Federation of New York, the Metropolitan Council for Jewish Poverty, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. She served as an officer of her synagogue, Temple Israel Center of White Plains. For many years, she sang in Carnegie Hall as a member of the chorus of the New York Oratorio Society. At her homes in New York and Connecticut, she was a warm and engaging hostess. She was a wonderful and devoted friend to so many. Her husband, her children and her precious grandchildren were the joys of her life. And she was the joy of their lives. She will live forever in their memories and in the memories of so many others. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, January 5, 2006 at 12 noon at Temple Israel Center, 280 Old Mamaroneck Road, White Plains, NY (914 948 - 2800)(www.templeisrae lcenter.org). Contributions may be made in her memory to UJA-Federation of New York, 130 East 59th Street, New York 10022. Goodbye Toby. We will always love you. The Nussbaum Family Bernie Nussbaum Emily, Peter, Frank, Alexis and Clive, Wylie, Levi and Gabriel NUSSBAUM--Toby. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the passing of Toby Nussbaum, a cherished leader and friend, whose lifelong commitment to the Jewish community and the State of Israel was marked by warmth, wisdom, and boundless generosity.

Toby was outspoken and charismatic, dedicated to goodness and justice, and respected by all. Her truly great and lifelong romance with Bernie was a model of sweetness and deep affection. Toby's energy and gracious style will forever be a part of her heroic legacy. May all her family be comforted by those at JTS who mourn with them. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman NUSSBAUM--Toby A. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of The Mount Sinai Medical Center mourn the passing of Toby A.

May, Chairman Kenneth L. Davis, M.D., President and CEO NUSSBAUM -- Toby. How amazingly full of vitality you were. How much we all learned from your bravery. As Janet, who also succumbed to cancer, and predeceased you by barely five weeks, said shortly after you were both diagnosed: ''Toby, I think this is carrying friendship too far.'' But that was impossible. For both of you, love, loyalty, and family were the hallmarks of your lives. We shall miss you terribly. Allan Gardner, Kim and Andrew Gardner, Elisabeth and Jeffrey Ostrow NUSSBAUM -- Toby. Active Board Member, loyal friend, ardent supporter of the arts in Israel, valiant fighter of her health.

Not Quite Yet, Anyway, if They Can Possibly Help It.;None;The Arts/Cultural Desk;article;Review;''Four Kings,'' an NBC sitcom about four single straight men who share an apartment and a disinclination to grow up, sounds awful. It's not. Some of the dialogue is quite funny, and as a posse, the slacker bachelors are appealing. That's mostly because the series was created by Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, the duo behind ''Will & Grace,'' that wicked, madcap look at urban gay life (which could be described as ''Breakfront Mountain'').
